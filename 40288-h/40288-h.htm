<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The present essay is the sequel of an article on
Greek music which the author contributed to the new
edition of <i>Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Antiquities</i> (London, 1890-91, art. <span class="smcap">Musica</span>).
In that article the long-standing controversy regarding the
nature of the ancient musical Modes was briefly
noticed, and some reasons were given for dissenting
from the views maintained by Westphal, and now
very generally accepted. A full discussion of the
subject would have taken up more space than was
then at the author's disposal, and he accordingly proposed
to the Delegates of the Clarendon Press to treat
the question in a separate form. He has now to thank
them for undertaking the publication of a work which
is necessarily addressed to a very limited circle.</p>

<p>The progress of the work has been more than once
delayed by the accession of materials. Much of it
was written before the author had the opportunity of
studying two very interesting documents first made
known in the course of last year in the <i>Bulletin de
correspondance hellénique</i> and the <i>Philologus</i>, viz. the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
so-called Seikelos inscription from Tralles, and a fragment
of the <i>Orestes</i> of Euripides. But a much greater
surprise was in store. The book was nearly ready
for publication last November, when the newspapers
reported that the French scholars engaged in excavating
on the site of Delphi had found several pieces
of musical notation, in particular a hymn to Apollo
dating from the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> As the known
remains of Greek music were either miserably brief,
or so late as hardly to belong to classical antiquity, it
was thought best to wait for the publication of the
new material. The French School of Athens must
be congratulated upon the good fortune which has
attended their enterprise, and also upon the excellent
form in which its results have been placed, within a
comparatively short time, at the service of students.
The writer of these pages, it will be readily understood,
had especial reason to be interested in the
announcement of a discovery which might give an
entirely new complexion to the whole argument. It
will be for the reader to determine whether the main
thesis of the book has gained or lost by the new
evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Hubert Parry prefaces his suggestive treatment
of Greek music by some remarks on the difficulty of
the subject. 'It still seems possible,' he observes,
'that a large portion of what has passed into the
domain of "well-authenticated fact" is complete misapprehension,
as Greek scholars have not time for a
thorough study of music up to the standard required
to judge securely of the matters in question, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
musicians as a rule are not extremely intimate with
Greek' (<i>The Art of Music</i>, p. 24). To the present
writer, who has no claim to the title of musician, the
scepticism expressed in these words appears to be
well founded. If his interpretation of the ancient
texts furnishes musicians like Mr. Parry with a somewhat
more trustworthy basis for their criticism of
Greek music as an art, his object will be fully attained.</p>

<h2>THE MODES OF ANCIENT GREEK MUSIC.</h2>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 1. <i>Introductory.</i></h2>


<p>The modes of ancient Greek music are of interest to
us, not only as the forms under which the Fine Art of
Music was developed by a people of extraordinary
artistic capability, but also on account of the peculiar
ethical influence ascribed to them by the greatest ancient
philosophers. It appears from a well-known passage
in the <i>Republic</i> of Plato, as well as from many other
references, that in ancient Greece there were certain
kinds or forms of music, which were known by national
or tribal names&mdash;Dorian, Ionian, Phrygian, Lydian and
the like: that each of these was believed to be capable,
not only of expressing particular emotions, but of reacting
on the sensibility in such a way as to exercise
a powerful and specific influence in the formation of
character: and consequently that the choice, among
these varieties, of the musical forms to be admitted into
the education of the state, was a matter of the most
serious practical concern. If on a question of this kind
we are inclined to distrust the imaginative temper of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Plato we have only to turn to the discussion of the same
subject in the <i>Politics</i> of Aristotle, and we shall find the
Platonic view criticised in some important details, but
treated in the main as being beyond controversy.</p>

<p>The word <b>harmonia</b>, 'harmony,' applied to these forms
of music by Plato and Aristotle, means literally 'fitting'
or 'adjustment,' hence the 'tuning' of a series of notes
on any principle, the formation of a 'scale' or 'gamut.'
Other ancient writers use the word <b>tropos</b>, whence
the Latin <i>modus</i> and our mood or 'mode,' generally
employed in this sense by English scholars. The word
'mode' is open to the objection that in modern music
it has a meaning which assumes just what it is our
present business to prove or disprove about the 'modes'
of Greek music. The word 'harmony,' however, is
still more misleading, and on the whole it seems best
to abide by the established use of 'mode' as a translation
of <b>harmonia</b>, trusting that the context will show
when the word has its distinctively modern sense, and
when it simply denotes a musical scale of some
particular kind.</p>

<p>The rhythm of music is also recognized by both Plato
and Aristotle as an important element in its moral
value. On this part of the subject, however, we have
much less material for a judgement. Plato goes on to
the rhythms after he has done with the modes, and
lays down the principle that they must not be complex
or varied, but must be the rhythms of a sober and brave
life. But he confesses that he cannot tell which these
are (<b>poia de poiou biou mimêmata ouk echô legein</b>), and
leaves the matter for future inquiry
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<h2>§ 2. <i>Statement of the question.</i></h2>

<p>What then are the musical forms to which Plato and
Aristotle ascribe this remarkable efficacy? And what
is the source of their influence on human emotion and
character?</p>

<p>There are two obvious relations in which the scales
employed in any system of music may stand to each
other. They may be related as two keys of the same
mode in modern music: that is to say, we may have to
do with a scale consisting of a fixed succession of intervals,
which may vary in pitch&mdash;may be 'transposed,' as
we say, from one pitch or key to another. Or the scales
may differ as the Major mode differs from the Minor,
namely in the order in which the intervals follow each
other. In modern music we have these two modes,
and each of them may be in any one of twelve keys.
It is evidently possible, also, that a name such as Dorian
or Lydian might denote a particular mode taken in a
particular key&mdash;that the scale so called should possess
a definite pitch as well as a definite series of intervals.</p>

<p>According to the theory which appears now to prevail
among students of Greek music, these famous
names had a double application. There was a Dorian
mode as well as a Dorian key, a Phrygian mode and
a Phrygian key, and so on. This is the view set forth
by Boeckh in the treatise which may be said to have
laid the foundations of our knowledge of Greek music
(<i>De Metris Pindari</i>, lib. III. cc. vii-xii). It is expounded,
along with much subsidiary speculation, in the successive
volumes which we owe to the fertile pen of Westphal;
and it has been adopted in the learned and excellent
<i>Histoire et Théorie de la Musique de l'Antiquité</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
M. Gevaert. According to these high authorities the
Greeks had a system of key (<b>tonoi</b>), and also a system
of modes (<b>harmoniai</b>), the former being based solely upon
difference of pitch, the latter upon the 'form' or species
(<b>eidos</b>) of the octave scale, that is to say, upon the order
of the intervals which compose it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 3. <i>The Authorities.</i></h2>


<p>The sources of our knowledge are the various
systematic treatises upon music which have come down
to us from Greek antiquity, together with incidental
references in other authors, chiefly poets and philosophers.
Of the systematic or 'technical' writers the
earliest and most important is Aristoxenus, a pupil of
Aristotle. His treatise on <i>Harmonics</i> (<b>harmonikê</b>) has
reached us in a fragmentary condition, but may be
supplemented to some extent from later works of the
same school. Among the incidental notices of music
the most considerable are the passages in the <i>Republic</i>
and the <i>Politics</i> already referred to. To these we have
to add a few other references in Plato and Aristotle;
a long fragment from the Platonic philosopher Heraclides
Ponticus, containing some interesting quotations
from earlier poets; a number of detached observations
collected in the nineteenth section of the Aristotelian
<i>Problems</i>; and one or two notices preserved in lexicographical
works, such as the <i>Onomasticon</i> of Pollux.</p>

<p>In these groups of authorities the scholars above
mentioned find the double use which they believe to
have been made of the names Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian
and the rest. In Aristoxenus they recognise that these
names are applied to a series of keys (<b>tonoi</b>), which
differed in pitch only. In Plato and Aristotle they find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the same names applied to scales called <b>harmoniai</b>, and
these scales, they maintain, differed primarily in the
order of their intervals. I shall endeavour to show
that there was no such double use: that in the earlier
periods of Greek music the scales in use, whether
called <b>tonoi</b> or <b>harmoniai</b>, differed primarily in <i>pitch</i>: that
the statements of ancient authors about them, down to
and including Aristoxenus, agree as closely as there is
reason to expect: and that the passages on which the
opposite view is based&mdash;all of them drawn from comparatively
late writers&mdash;either do not relate to these
ancient scales at all, or point to the emergence in
post-classical times of some new forms or tendencies
of musical art. I propose in any case to adhere as
closely as possible to a chronological treatment of the
evidence which is at our command, and I hope to make
it probable that the difficulties of the question may be
best dealt with on this method.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 4. <i>The Early Poets.</i></h2>

<p>The earliest of the passages now in question comes
from the poet Pratinas, a contemporary of Aeschylus.
It is quoted by Heraclides Ponticus, in the course of
a long fragment preserved by Athenaeus (xiv. cc. 19-21,
p. 624 <i>c</i>-626 <i>a</i>). The words are:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><b>mête syntonon diôke mête tan aneimenan</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>Iasti mousan, alla tan messan neôn</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>arouran aiolize tô melei.</b><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Follow neither a highly-strung music nor the low-pitched
Ionian, but turning over the middle plough-land
be an Aeolian in your melody.' Westphal takes the
word <b>'Iasti</b> with <b>syntonon</b> as well as with <b>aneimenan</b>, and
infers that there were two kinds of Ionian, a 'highly-strung'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and a 'relaxed' or low-pitched. But this is not
required by the words, and seems less natural than the
interpretation which I have given. All that the passage
proves is that in the time of Pratinas a composer had
the choice of at least three scales: one (or more) of
which the pitch was high (<b>syntonos</b>); another of low
pitch (<b>aneimenê</b>), which was called <i>Ionian</i>; and a third,
intermediate between the others, and known as <i>Aeolian</i>.
Later in the same passage we are told that Pratinas
spoke of the 'Aeolian harmony' (<b>prepei toi pasin
aoidolabraktais Aiolis harmonia</b>). And the term is also
found, with the epithet 'deep-sounding,' in a passage
quoted from the hymn to Demeter of a contemporary
poet, Lasus of Hermione (Athen. xiv. 624 <i>e</i>):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><b>Damatra melpô Koran te Klymenoio alochon Meliboian,</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>hymnôn anagôn Aiolid' hama barybromon harmonian.</b><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With regard to the Phrygian and Lydian scales
Heraclides (<i>l. c.</i>) quotes an interesting passage from
Telestes of Selinus, in which their introduction is
ascribed to the colony that was said to have followed
Pelops from Asia Minor to the Peloponnesus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><b>prôtoi para kratêras Hellênôn en aulois</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>synopadoi Pelopos matros oreias phrygion aeison nomon;</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>toi d' oxyphônois pêktidôn psalmois krekon</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>Dydion hymnon.</b><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'The comrades of Pelops were the first who beside
the Grecian cups sang with the flute (<b>aulos</b>) the Phrygian
measure of the Great Mother; and these again by shrill-voiced
notes of the <i>pectis</i> sounded a Lydian hymn.'
The epithet <b>oxyphônos</b> is worth notice in connexion with
other evidence of the high pitch of the music known as Lydian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
The Lydian mode is mentioned by Pindar, <i>Nem.</i> 4. 45:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><b>exyphaine glykeia kai tod' autika phorminx</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>Lydia syn harmonia melos pephilêmenon.</b><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Dorian is the subject of an elaborate jest made
at the expense of Cleon in the <i>Knights</i> of Aristophanes,
ll. 985-996:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><b>alla kai tod' egô ge thaumazô tês hyomousias</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>autou phasi gar auton hoi paides hoi xynephoitôn</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>tên Dôristi monên enarmottesthai thama tên lyran,</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>allên d' ouk ethelein labein; kata ton kitharistên</b><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><b>outos ou dynatai mathein ên mê Dôrodokêsti.</b><br /></span>
</div></div>

<h2>§ 5. <i>Plato.</i></h2>

<p>Following the order of time, we come next to the
passage in the <i>Republic</i> (p. 398), where Socrates is
endeavouring to determine the kinds of music to be
admitted for the use of his future 'guardians,' in
accordance with the general principles which are to
govern their education. First among these principles
is the condemnation of all undue expression of grief.
'What modes of music (<b>harmoniai</b>),' he asks, are plaintive
(<b>thrênôdeis</b>)?' 'The <i>Mixo-lydian</i>,' Glaucon replies, 'and
the <i>Syntono-lydian</i>, and such-like.' These accordingly
Socrates excludes. 'But again, drunkenness and slothfulness
are no less forbidden to the guardians; which
of the modes are soft and convivial (<b>malakai te kai
sympotikai</b>)?' '<i>Ionian</i>,' says Glaucon, 'and <i>Lydian</i>,
those which are called slack (<b>chalarai</b>).' 'Which then
remain?' 'Seemingly <i>Dorian</i> and <i>Phrygian</i>.' 'I do
not know the modes,' says Socrates, 'but leave me one
that will imitate the tones and accents of a brave man
enduring danger or distress, fighting with constancy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
against fortune: and also one fitted for the work of
peace, for prayer heard by the gods, for the successful
persuasion or exhortation of men, and generally for the
sober enjoyment of ease and prosperity.' Two such
modes, one for Courage and one for Temperance, are
declared by Glaucon to be found in the Dorian and the
Phrygian. In the <i>Laches</i> (p. 188) there is a passing
reference in which a similar view is expressed. Plato
is speaking of the character of a brave man as being
metaphorically a 'harmony,' by which his life is made
consonant to reason&mdash;'a Dorian harmony,' he adds&mdash;playing
upon the musical sense of the word&mdash;'not an
Ionian, certainly not a Phrygian or a Lydian, but that
one which only is truly Hellenic' (<b>atechnôs Dôristi, all'
ouk Iasti, oiomai de oude Phrygisti oude Lydisti, all' hê per
monê Hellênikê estin harmonia</b>). The exclusion of Phrygian
may be due to the fact that the virtue discussed in the
<i>Laches</i> is courage; but it is in agreement with Aristotle's
opinion. The absence of Aeolian from both the Platonic
passages seems to show that it had gone out of use
in his time (but cp. <a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>).</p>

<p>The point of view from which Plato professes to
determine the right modes to be used in his ideal
education appears clearly in the passage of the <i>Republic</i>.
The modes first rejected are those which are high in
pitch. The Syntono-lydian or 'high-strung Lydian'
is shown by its name to be of this class. The Mixo-lydian
is similar, as we shall see from Aristotle and
other writers. The second group which he condemns
is that of the 'slack' or low-pitched. Thus it is on the
profoundly Hellenic principle of choosing the mean
between opposite extremes that he approves of the
Dorian and Phrygian pitch. The application of this
principle was not a new one, for it had been already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
laid down by Pratinas: <b>mête syntonon diôke mête tan
aneimenan</b>.</p>

<p>The three chapters which Aristotle devotes to a discussion
of the use of music in the state (<i>Politics</i> viii.
cc. 5-7), and in which he reviews and criticises the
Platonic treatment of the same subject, will be found
entirely to bear out the view now taken. It is also
supported by the commentary of Plutarch, in his dialogue
on Music (cc. 15-17), of which we shall have
something to say hereafter. Meanwhile, following
the chronological order of our authorities, we come
next to the fragment of Heraclides Ponticus already
mentioned (Athen. xiv. p. 624 <i>c</i>-626 <i>a</i>).</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 6. <i>Heraclides Ponticus.</i></h2>

<p>The chief doctrine maintained by Heraclides Ponticus
is that there are three modes (<b>harmoniai</b>), belonging to
the three Greek races&mdash;Dorian, Aeolian, Ionian. The
Phrygian and Lydian, in his view, had no right to the
name of mode or 'harmony' (<b>oud' harmonian phêsi dein
kaleisthai tên Phrygion, kathaper oude tên Lydion</b>). The
three which he recognized had each a marked ethos.
The Dorian reflected the military traditions and temper
of Sparta. The Aeolian, which Heraclides identified
with the Hypo-dorian of his own time, answered to the
national character of the Thessalians, which was bold
and gay, somewhat overweening and self-indulgent, but
hospitable and chivalrous. Some said that it was called
Hypo-dorian because it was below the Dorian on the
<b>aulos</b> or flute; but Heraclides thinks that the name
merely expressed likeness to the Dorian character
(<b>Dôrion men autên ou nomizein, prosempherê de pôs ekeinê</b>).
The Ionian, again, was harsh and severe, expressive of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the unkindly disposition fostered amid the pride and
material welfare of Miletus. Heraclides is inclined to
say that it was not properly a distinct musical scale or
'harmony,' but a strange aberration in the form of the
musical scale (<b>tropon de tina thaumaston schêmatos harmonias</b>).
He goes on to protest against those who do
not appreciate differences of kind (<b>tas kat' eidos diaphoras</b>),
and are guided only by the high or low pitch of the
notes (<b>tê tôn phthongôn exytêti kai barytêti</b>); so that
they make a Hyper-mixolydian, and another again
above that. 'I do not see,' he adds, 'that the Hyper-phrygian
has a distinct ethos; and yet some say that
they have discovered a new mode (<b>harmonia</b>), the Hypo-phrygian.
But a mode ought to have a distinct moral
or emotional character (<b>eidos echein ethous hê pathous</b>), as
the Locrian, which was in use in the time of Simonides
and Pindar, but went out of fashion again.' The
Phrygian and Lydian, as we have seen, were said to
have been brought to the Peloponnesus by the followers
of Pelops.</p>

<p>The tone as well as the substance of this extract
makes it evident that the opinions of Heraclides on
questions of theoretical music must be accepted with
considerable reserve. The notion that the Phrygian
and Lydian scales were 'barbarous' and opposed to
Hellenic ethos was apparently common enough, though
largely due (as we may gather from several indications)
to national prejudice. But no one, except Heraclides,
goes so far as to deny them the name of <b>harmonia</b>. The
threefold division into Dorian, Aeolian and Ionian must
also be arbitrary. It is to be observed that Heraclides
obtains his Aeolian by identifying the Aeolian of Pratinas
and other early poets with the mode called Hypo-dorian
in his own time. The circumstance that Plato mentions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
neither Aeolian nor Hypo-dorian suggests rather that
Aeolian had gone out of use before Hypo-dorian came
in. The conjecture of Boeckh that Ionian was the
same as the later Hypo-phrygian (<i>De Metr. Pind.</i> iii. 8)
is open to a similar objection. The Ionian mode was
at least as old as Pratinas, whereas the Hypo-phrygian
was a novelty in the time of Heraclides. The protest
which Heraclides makes against classifying modes
merely according to their pitch is chiefly valuable as
proving that the modes were as a matter of fact usually
classified from that point of view. It is far from proving
that there was any other principle which Heraclides
wished to adopt&mdash;such, for example, as difference in the
intervals employed, or in their succession. His 'differences
of kind' (<b>tas kat' eidos diaphoras</b>) are not necessarily
to be explained from the technical use of <b>eidos</b> for the
'species' of the octave. What he complains of seems
to be the multiplication of modes&mdash;Hyper-mixolydian,
Hyper-phrygian, Hypo-phrygian&mdash;beyond the legitimate
requirements of the art. The Mixo-lydian (<i>e.g.</i>)
is high-pitched and plaintive: what more can the
Hyper-mixolydian be? The Hypo-phrygian is a new
mode: Heraclides denies it a distinctive ethos. His
view seems to be that the number of modes should not
be greater than the number of varieties in temper or
emotion of which music is capable. But there is
nothing to show that he did not regard pitch as the
chief element, or one of the chief elements, of musical
expression.</p>

<p>The absence of the name Hypo-lydian, taken with
the description of Hypo-dorian as 'below the Dorian,'
would indicate that the Hypo-dorian of Heraclides was
not the later mode of that name, but was a semitone
below the Dorian, in the place afterwards occupied by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the Hypo-lydian. This is confirmed, as we shall see,
by Aristoxenus (<a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>).</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 7. <i>Aristotle&mdash;the Politics.</i></h2>

<p>Of the writers who deal with music from the point
of view of the cultivated layman, Aristotle is undoubtedly
the most instructive. The chapters in his
<i>Politics</i> which treat of music in its relation to the state
and to morality go much more deeply than Plato does
into the grounds of the influence which musical forms
exert upon temper and feeling. Moreover, Aristotle's
scope is wider, not being confined to the education of
the young; and his treatment is evidently a more
faithful reflexion of the ordinary Greek notions and
sentiment. He begins (<i>Pol.</i> viii. 5, p. 1340 <i>a</i> 38) by
agreeing with Plato as to the great importance of the
subject for practical politics. Musical forms, he holds,
are not mere <i>symbols</i> (<b>sêmeia</b>), acting through association,
but are an actual <i>copy</i> or reflex of the forms of
moral temper (<b>en de tois melesin autois esti mimêmata tôn
êthôn</b>); and this is the ground of the different moral
influence exercised by different modes (<b>harmoniai</b>). By
some of them, especially by the Mixo-lydian, we are
moved to a plaintive and depressed temper (<b>diatithesthai
odyrtikôterôs kai synestêkotôs mallon</b>); by others, such
as those which are called the 'relaxed' (<b>aneimenai</b>), we are
disposed to 'softness' of mind (<b>malakôterôs tên dianoian</b>).
The Dorian, again, is the only one under whose
influence men are in a middle and settled mood (<b>mesôs
kai kathestêkotôs malista</b>): while the Phrygian makes
them excited (<b>enthousiastikous</b>). In a later chapter (Pol.
viii. 7, p. 1342 <i>a</i> 32), he returns to the subject of the
Phrygian. Socrates, he thinks, ought not to have left
it with the Dorian, especially since he condemned the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
flute (<b>aulos</b>), which has the same character among
instruments as the Phrygian among modes, both being
orgiastic and emotional. The Dorian, as all agree, is
the most steadfast (<b>stasimôtatê</b>), and has most of the
ethos of courage; and, as compared with other modes, it
has the character which Aristotle himself regards as the
universal criterion of excellence, viz. that of being the
mean between opposite excesses. Aristotle, therefore,
certainly understood Plato to have approved the
Dorian and the Phrygian as representing the mean
in respect of pitch, while other modes were either too
high or too low. He goes on to defend the use of
the 'relaxed' modes on the ground that they furnish a
music that is still within the powers of those whose
voice has failed from age, and who therefore are not
able to sing the high-pitched modes (<b>oion tois apeirêkosi
dia chronon ou rhadion adein tas syntonous harmonias, alla
tas aneimenas hê physis hypoballei tois têlikoutois</b>). In
this passage the meaning of the words <b>syntonos</b> and
<b>aneimenos</b> is especially clear.</p>

<p>In the same discussion (c. 6), Aristotle refers to the
distinction between music that is ethical, music suited
to action, and music that inspires religious excitement
(<b>ta men êthika, ta de praktika, ta ho enthousiastika</b>). The
last of these kinds serves as a 'purification' (<b>katharsis</b>).
The excitement is calmed by giving it vent; and the
morbid condition of the ethos is met by music of high
pitch and exceptional 'colour' (<b>tôn harmoniôn parekbaseis
kai tôn melôn ta syntona kai parakechrôsmena</b>).</p>

<p>In a different connexion (<i>Pol.</i> iv. 3, p. 1290 <i>a</i> 20),
dealing with the opinion that all forms of government
are ultimately reducible to two, viz. oligarchy and
democracy, Aristotle compares the view of some who
held that there are properly only two musical modes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Dorian and Phrygian,&mdash;the other scales being mere
varieties of these two. Rather, he says, there is in
each case a right form, or two right forms at most,
from which the rest are declensions (<b>parekbaseis</b>),&mdash;on
one side to 'high-pitched' and imperious oligarchies,
on the other to 'relaxed' and 'soft' forms of popular
government (<b>oligarchikas men tas syntonôteras kai
despotikônteras, tas d' aneimenas kai malakas dêmotikas</b>).
This is obviously the Platonic doctrine of two right
keys, holding the mean between high and low.</p>

<h2>§ 8. <i>The Aristotelian Problems.</i></h2>

<p>Some further notices of the <b>harmoniai</b> or modes are
contained in the so-called <i>Problems</i>,&mdash;a collection which
is probably not the work of Aristotle himself, but
can hardly be later than the Aristotelian age. What
is said in it of the modes is clearly of the period before
the reform of Aristoxenus. In one place (<i>Probl.</i> xix.
48) the question is asked why the Hypo-dorian and
Hypo-phrygian are not used in the <i>chorus</i> of tragedy.
One answer is that the Hypo-phrygian has the ethos
of action (<b>êthos echei praktikon</b>), and that the Hypo-dorian
is the expression of a lofty and unshaken character;
both of these things being proper to the heroic
personages on the stage, but not to the chorus, which
represents the average spectator, and takes no part in
the action. Hence the music suited to the chorus is
that of emotion venting itself in passive complaint:&mdash;a
description which fits the other modes, but least of all
the exciting and orgiastic Hypo-phrygian. On the
contrary (the writer adds) the passive attitude is
especially expressed by the Mixo-lydian. The view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
here taken of the Hypo-dorian evidently agrees with
that of Heraclides Ponticus (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>).</p>

<p>The relation which Plato assumes between high
pitch and the excitement of passion, and again between
lowness of pitch and 'softness' or self-indulgence
(<b>malakia kai argia</b>), is recognized in the <i>Problems</i>,
xix. 49 <b>epei de ho men barys phthongos malakos kai êremaios
estin, ho de oxys kinêtikos, k.t.l.</b>: 'since a deep note is
soft and calm, and a high note is exciting, &amp;c.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 9. <i>The Rhetoric.</i></h2>

<p>The word <b>tonos</b> occurs several times in Aristotle
with the sense of 'pitch,' but is not applied by him to
the keys of music. The nearest approach to such a
use may be found in a passage of the <i>Rhetoric</i> (iii. 1,
p. 1403 <i>b</i> 27).</p>

<p>Speaking of the rise of acting (<b>hypokrisis</b>), which was
originally the business of the poet himself, but had
grown into a distinct art, capable of theoretical as well
as practical treatment, he observes that a similar art
might be formed for oratory. 'Such an art would lay
down rules directing how to use the voice so as to
suit each variety of feeling,&mdash;when it should be loud,
when low, when intermediate;&mdash;and how to use the
keys, when the pitch of the voice should be high or low
or middle (<b>kai pôs tois tonois, oion oxeia kai bareia kai
mesê</b>, sc. <b>phônê</b>); and the rhythms, which to use for each
case. For there are three things which men study,
viz. quantity (<i>i. e.</i> loudness of sound), tune, and
rhythm (<b>tria gar esti peri hôn skopousi, tauta d' esti
megethos, harmonia, rhythmos</b>).' The passage is interesting as
showing the value which Aristotle set upon pitch as an
element of effect. And the use of <b>harmonia</b> in reference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to the pitch of the voice, and as virtually equivalent to
<b>tonos</b>, is especially worthy of note.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 10. <i>Aristoxenus.</i></h2>

<p>Our next source of information is the technical writer
Aristoxenus, a contemporary and pupil of Aristotle.
Of his many works on the subject of music three books
only have survived, bearing the title <b>harmonika otoicheia</b>
<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.
In the treatment adopted by Aristoxenus the chapter
on keys follows the chapter on 'systems' (<b>systêmata</b>).
By a <b>systêma</b> he means a scale consisting of a certain
succession of intervals: in other words, a series of
notes whose relative pitch is determined. Such a system
may vary in absolute pitch, and the <b>tonoi</b> or keys are
simply the different degrees of pitch at which a particular
system is taken (<b>tous tonous eph' ôn tithemena ta systêmata
melôdeitai</b>). When the system and the key are both
given it is evident that the whole series of notes is
determined.</p>

<p>Aristoxenus is the chief authority on the keys of
Greek music. In this department he is considered
to have done for Greece what Bach's <i>Wohltemperirtes
Clavier</i> did for modern Europe. It is true that the
scheme of keys which later writers ascribe to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>'No one,' says Aristoxenus (p. 37 Meib.), 'has told
us a word about the keys, either how they are to be
arrived at (<b>tina tropon lêpteon</b>), or from what point of
view their number is to be determined. Musicians
assign the place of the keys very much as the different
cities regulate the days of the month. The Corinthians,
for example, will be found counting a day as the tenth
of the month, while with the Athenians it is the fifth,
and in some other place the eighth. Some authorities
on music (<b>harmonikoi</b>) say that the Hypo-dorian is the
lowest key, the Mixo-lydian a semitone higher, the
Dorian again a semitone higher, the Phrygian a tone
above the Dorian, and similarly the Lydian a tone above
the Phrygian. Others add the Hypo-phrygian flute
[<i>i. e.</i> the scale of the flute so called] at the lower end
of the list. Others, again, looking to the holes of the
flute (<b>pros tên tôn aulôn trupêsin blepontes</b>), separate
the three lowest keys, viz. the Hypo-phrygian, Hypo-dorian,
and Dorian, by the interval of three-quarters of
a tone (<b>trisi diesesin</b>), but the Phrygian from the Dorian
by a tone, the Lydian from the Phrygian again by
three-quarters of a tone, and the Mixo-lydian from the
Lydian by a like interval. But as to what determines
the interval between one key and another they have
told us nothing.'</p>

<p>It will be seen that (with one marked exception) there
was agreement about the order of the keys in respect
of pitch, and that some at least had reduced the intervals
to the succession of tones and semitones which characterises
the diatonic scale. The exception is the Mixo-lydian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
which some ranked immediately below the
Dorian, others above the Lydian. Westphal attributes
this strange discrepancy to the accidental displacing
of some words in the MSS. of Aristoxenus<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. However
this may be, it is plain that in the time of Aristoxenus
considerable progress had been made towards the
scheme of keys which was afterwards connected with
his name. This may be represented by the following
table, in which for the sake of comparison the later
Hypo-lydian and Hypo-dorian are added in brackets:</p>

<h2>§ 11. <i>Names of Keys</i> (hypo-).</h2>

<p>A point that deserves special notice at this place is
the use of the prefix <i>Hypo-</i> (<b>hypo-</b>) in the names of keys.
In the final Aristoxenean system <i>Hypo-</i> implies that
a key is lower by the interval of a Fourth than the key
to whose name it is prefixed. This convention served
to bring out the special relation between the two keys,
viz. to show that they are related (to use modern language)
as the keys of a tonic and dominant. In the
scheme of keys now in question there is only one
instance of this use of <i>Hypo-</i>, namely in the Hypo-phrygian,
the most recently introduced. It must have
been on the analogy of this name that the term Hypo-dorian
was shifted from the key immediately below the
Dorian to the new key a Fourth below it, and that
the new term Hypo-lydian was given to the old Hypo-dorian
in accordance with its similar relation to the
Lydian. In the time of Aristoxenus, then, this technical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
sense of <i>Hypo-</i> had not yet been established, but was
coming into use. It led naturally to the employment
of <i>Hyper-</i> in the inverse sense, viz. to denote a key
a Fourth higher (the key of the sub-dominant). By
further steps, of which there is no record, the Greek
musicians arrived at the idea of a key for every semitone
in the octave; and thus was formed the system
of thirteen keys, ascribed to Aristoxenus by later
writers. (See the scheme at the end of this book,
Table II.) Whether in fact it was entirely his work
may be doubted. In any case he had formed a clear
conception&mdash;the want of which he noted in his predecessors&mdash;of
the principles on which a theoretically
complete scheme of keys should be constructed.</p>

<p>In the discussions to which we have been referring,
Aristoxenus invariably employs the word <b>tonos</b> in the
sense of 'key.' The word <b>harmonia</b> in his writings is
equivalent to 'Enharmonic genus' (<b>genos enarmonion</b>), the
<i>genus</i> of music which made use of the Enharmonic
<i>diësis</i> or quarter-tone. Thus he never speaks, as Plato
and Aristotle do, of the Dorian (or Phrygian or Lydian)
<b>harmonia</b>, but only of the <b>tonoi</b> so named. There is
indeed one passage in which certain octave scales are
said by Aristoxenus to have been called <b>harmoniai</b>: but
this, as will be shown, is a use which is to be otherwise
explained (<a href="#Page_54">see p. 54</a>).</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 12. <i>Plutarch's Dialogue on Music.</i></h2>

<p>After the time of Aristoxenus the technical writers
on music make little or no use of the term <b>harmonia</b>.
Their word for 'key' is <b>tonos</b>; and the octachord scales
which are distinguished by the succession of their
intervals are called 'species of the octave' (<b>eidê tou dia</b>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<b>pasôn</b>). The modes of the classical period, however,
were still objects of antiquarian and philosophic
interest, and authors who treated them from this point
of view naturally kept up the old designation. A good
specimen of the writings of this class has survived in
the <i>dialogus de musicâ</i> of Plutarch. Like most productions
of the time, it is mainly a compilation from
earlier works now lost. Much of it comes from Aristoxenus,
and there is therefore a special fitness in
dealing with it in this place, by way of supplement
to the arguments drawn directly from the Aristoxenean
<i>Harmonics</i>. The following are the chief passages
bearing on the subject of our enquiry:</p>

<p>(1) In cc. 15-17 we find a commentary of some
interest on the Platonic treatment of the modes.
Plutarch is dwelling on the superiority of the older
and simpler music, and appeals to the opinion of Plato.</p>

<p>'The Lydian mode (<b>harmonia</b>) Plato objects to because
it is high (<b>oxeia</b>) and suited to lamentation. Indeed it
is said to have been originally devised for that purpose:
for Aristoxenus tells us, in his first book on Music, that
Olympus first employed the Lydian mode on the flute
in a dirge (<b>epikêdeion aulêsai Lydisti</b>) over the Python.
But some say that Melanippides began this kind of
music. And Pindar in his paeans says that the Lydian
mode (<b>harmonia</b>) was first brought in by Anthippus in an
ode on the marriage of Niobe. But others say that
Torrhebus first used that mode, as Dionysius the
Iambus relates.'</p>

<p>'The Mixo-lydian, too, is pathetic and suitable to
tragedy. And Aristoxenus says that Sappho was
the inventor of the Mixo-lydian, and that from her
the tragic poets learned it. They combined it with
the Dorian, since that mode gives grandeur and dignity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and the other pathos, and these are the two elements
of tragedy. But in his Historical Treatise on Music
(<b>historika tês harmonias hypomnêmata</b>) he says that Pythoclides
the flute-player was the discoverer of it. And
Lysis says that Lamprocles the Athenian, perceiving
that in it the disjunctive tone (<b>diazeuxis</b>) is not where it
was generally supposed to be, but is at the upper
end of the scale, made the form of it to be that of the
octave from Paramesê to Hypatê Hypatôn (<b>toiouton
autês apergasasthai to schêma hoion to apo paramesês epi
hypatên hypatôn</b>). Moreover, it is said that the relaxed
Lydian (<b>epaneimenên Lydisti</b>), which is the opposite
of the Mixo-lydian, being similar to the Ionian (<b>paraplêsian
ousan tê Iadi</b>), was invented by Damon the
Athenian.'</p>

<p>'These modes then, the one plaintive, the other
relaxed (<b>eklelymenê</b>), Plato properly rejected, and chose
the Dorian, as befitting warlike and temperate men.'</p>

<p>In this passage the 'high-pitched Lydian' (<b>Syntonolydisti</b>)
of Plato is called simply Lydian. There is
every reason to suppose that it is the mode called
Lydian by Aristotle and Heraclides Ponticus
<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
If this is so, it follows almost of necessity that the Lydian
of Plato, called slack (<b>chalara</b>) by him&mdash;Plutarch's
<b>epaneimenê Lydisti</b>&mdash;is to be identified with the later</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Hypo-lydian. The point, however, is not free from
difficulty: for (as we have seen, <a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>), the name
Hypo-lydian is not in the list of keys given by
Aristoxenus&mdash;the key which was ultimately called
Hypo-lydian being known to him as the Hypo-dorian.
If, however, the confusion in the nomenclature of the
keys was as great as Aristoxenus himself describes, such
a contradiction as this cannot be taken to prove much.
<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The statement that the 'relaxed Lydian' was the
opposite of the Mixo-lydian, and similar to the Ionian,
has given rise to much speculation. In what sense,
we naturally ask, can a key or a mode be said to be
'opposite' or 'similar' to another? I venture to
think that it is evidently a mere paraphrase of Plato's
language. The relaxed Lydian is opposed to the
Mixo-lydian because it is at the other end of the scale
in pitch; and it is similar to the Ionian because the
two are classed together (as <b>chalarai</b>) by Plato.</p>

<p>The Mixo-lydian, according to Aristoxenus, was
employed by the tragic poets in close union with the
Dorian mode (<b>labontas syzeuxai tê Dôristi</b>). The
fact that the Mixo-lydian was just a Fourth higher than
the Dorian must have made the transition from the one
to the other a natural and melodious one. As Aristoxenus
suggested, it would be especially used to
mark the passage from grandeur and dignity to pathos
which is the chief characteristic of tragedy (<b>hê men to</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p><b>megaloprepes kai axiômatikon apodidôsin, hê de to pathêtikon,
memiktai de dia toutôn tragôdia</b>). It is worth
noticing that this relation obtained in the scheme of the
musicians who did not arrange the keys according
to the diatonic scale, but in some way suggested by
the form of the flute (<b>hoi pros tên tôn aulôn trypêsin
blepontes</b>). It may therefore be supposed to have
been established before the relative pitch of other keys
had been settled.</p>

<p>So far the passage of Plutarch goes to confirm the
view of the Platonic modes according to which they
were distinguished chiefly, if not wholly, by difference
of pitch. We come now, however, to a statement
which apparently tends in the opposite direction, viz.
that a certain Lamprocles of Athens noticed that in
the Mixo-lydian mode the Disjunctive Tone (<b>diazeuxis</b>)
was at the upper end of the scale (<b>epi to oxy</b>), and
reformed the scale accordingly. This must refer to
an octave scale of the form <i>b c d e f g a b</i>, consisting of
the two tetrachords <i>b-e</i> and <i>e-a</i>, and the tone <i>a-b</i>.
Such an octave may or may not be in the Mixo-lydian
key: it is certainly of the Mixo-lydian species (<a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>).</p>

<p>In estimating the value of this piece of evidence it is
necessary to remark, in the first place, that the authority
is no longer that of Aristoxenus, but of a certain Lysis,
of whom nothing else seems to be known. That he
was later than Aristoxenus is made probable by his
way of describing the Mixo-lydian octave, viz. by
reference to the notes in the Perfect System by which
it is exemplified (Hypatê Hypatôn to Paramesê). In
Aristoxenus, as we shall see (<a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>), the primitive
octave (from Hypatê to Nêtê) is the only scale the
notes of which are mentioned by name. But even if
the notice is comparatively early, it is worth observing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
that the Mixo-lydian scale thus ascribed to Lamprocles
consists of two tetrachords of the normal type,
viz. with the semitone or <b>pyknon</b> at the lower end of
the scale (Diatonic <i>e f g a</i>, Enharmonic <i>e e* f a</i>). The
difference is that they are conjunct, whereas in the
primitive standard octave (<i>e&mdash;e</i>) the tetrachords are
disjunct (<i>e-a b-e</i>). This, however, is a variety which
is provided for by the tetrachord Synêmmenôn in the
Perfect System, and which may have been allowed
in the less complete scales of earlier times. In any
case the existence of a scale of this particular form
does not prove that the octaves of other species were
recognised in the same way.</p>

<p>(2) In another passage (c. 6) Plutarch says of the
ancient music of the cithara that it was characterised
by perfect simplicity. It was not allowed, he tells us,
to change the mode (<b>metapherein tas harmonias</b>) or the
rhythm: for in the primitive lyrical compositions
called 'Nomes' (<b>nomoi</b>) they preserved in each its
proper pitch (<b>tên oikeian tasin</b>). Here the word <b>tasis</b>
indicates that by <b>harmoniai</b> Plutarch (or the older author
from whom he was quoting) meant particular <i>keys</i>. This
is fully confirmed by the use of <b>tonos</b> in a passage a
little further on (c. 8), where Plutarch gives an account
of an innovation in this matter made by Sacadas of
Argos (fl. 590 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>).
'There being three keys (<b>tonoi</b>) in
the time of Polymnastus and Sacadas, viz. the Dorian,
Phrygian and Lydian, it is said that Sacadas composed
a strophe in each of these keys, and taught the chorus
to sing them, the first in the Dorian, the second in the
Phrygian, and the third in the Lydian key: and this
composition was called the "three-part Nome" (<b>nomos
trimerês</b>) on account of the change of key.' In Westphal's
<i>Harmonik und Melopöie</i> (ed. 1863, p. 76, cp. p. 62)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
he explains this notice of the ancient modes (<b>harmoniai</b>,
<i>Tonarten</i>), observing that the word <b>tonos</b> is there used
improperly for what the technical writers call <b>eidos
tou dia pasôn</b>.</p>

<p>(3) In a somewhat similar passage of the same work
(c. 19) Plutarch is contending that the fewness of the
notes in the scales used by the early musicians did not
arise from ignorance, but was characteristic of their
art, and necessary to its peculiar ethos. Among other
points he notices that the tetrachord Hypatôn was not
used in Dorian music (<b>en tois Dôriois</b>), and this, he says,
was not because they did not know of that tetrachord&mdash;for
they used it in other keys (<b>tonoi</b>)&mdash;but they left it
out in the Dorian key for the sake of preserving its
ethos, the beauty of which they valued (<b>dia dê tên tou
êthous phylakên aphêroun tou Dôriou tonou, timôntes to
kalon autou</b>). Here again Westphal (<i>Aristoxenus</i>,
p. 476) has to take <b>tonos</b> to mean <b>harmonia</b> or 'mode'
(in his language <i>Tonart</i>, not <i>Transpositionsscala</i>). For
in the view of those who distinguish <b>harmonia</b> from <b>tonos</b>
it is the <b>harmonia</b> upon which the ethos of music depends.
Plutarch himself had just been saying (in c. 17)
that Plato preferred the Dorian <b>harmonia</b> on account of
its grave and elevated character (<b>epei poly to semnon
estin en tê Dôristi, tautên proutimêsen</b>). On the other
hand the usual sense of <b>tonos</b> is supported by the consideration
that the want of the tetrachord Hypatôn
would affect the pitch of the scale rather than the succession
of its intervals.</p>

<p>It seems to follow from a comparison of these three
passages that Plutarch was not aware of any difference
of meaning between the words <b>tonos</b> and <b>harmonia</b>, or
any distinction in the scales of Greek music such as
has been supposed to be conveyed by these words.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Another synonym of <b>tonos</b> which becomes very
common in the later writers on music is the word
<b>tropos</b>.<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
In the course of the passage of Plutarch
already referred to (<i>De Mus.</i> c. 17) it is applied to the
Dorian mode, which Plutarch has just called <b>harmonia</b>.
As <b>tropos</b> is always used in the later writers of the
keys (<b>tonoi</b>) of Aristoxenus, this may be added to the
places in which <b>harmonia</b> has the same meaning.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 13. <i>Modes employed on different Instruments.</i></h2>

<p>In the anonymous treatise on music published by
Bellermann<a name="FNanchor_2_7" id="FNanchor_2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
(c. 28), we find the following statement
regarding the use of the modes or keys in the scales of
different instruments:</p>

<p>'The Phrygian mode (<b>harmonia</b>) has the first place
on wind-instruments: witness the first discoverers&mdash;Marsyas,
Hyagnis, Olympus&mdash;who were Phrygians.
Players on the water-organ (<b>hydraulai</b>) use only six
modes (<b>tropoi</b>), viz. Hyper-lydian, Hyper-ionian, Lydian,
Phrygian, Hypo-lydian, Hypo-phrygian. Players
on the cithara tune their instrument to these four,
viz. Hyper-ionian, Lydian, Hypo-lydian, Ionian. Flute-players
employ seven, viz. Hyper-aeolian, Hyper-ionian,
Hypo-lydian, Lydian, Phrygian, Ionian, Hypo-phrygian.
Musicians who concern themselves with orchestic
(choral music) use seven, viz. Hyper-dorian, Lydian,
Phrygian, Dorian, Hypo-lydian, Hypo-phrygian, Hypo-dorian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>In this passage it is evident that we have to do with
keys of the scheme attributed to Aristoxenus, including
the two (Hyper-aeolian and Hyper-lydian) which were
said to have been added after his time. The number
of scales mentioned is sufficient to prove that the reference
is not to the seven species of the octave. Yet
the word <b>harmonia</b> is used of these keys, and with it,
seemingly as an equivalent, the word <b>tropos</b>.</p>

<p>Pollux (<i>Onom.</i> iv. 78) gives a somewhat different
account of the modes used on the flute: <b>kai harmonia
men aulêtikê Dôristi, Phrygisti, Lydios kai Iônikê, kai
syntonos Lydisti hên Anthippos exeure</b>. But this statement,
as has been already pointed out (<a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>), is a piece of
antiquarian learning, and therefore takes no notice of the
more recent keys, as Hyper-aeolian and Hyper-ionian,
or even Hypo-phrygian (unless that is the Ionian of
Pollux). The absence of Dorian from the list given
by the <i>Anonymus</i> is curious: but it seems that at that
time it was equally unknown to the cithara and the
water-organ. There is therefore no reason to think
that the two lists are framed with reference to different
things. That is to say, <b>harmonia</b> in Pollux has the same
meaning as <b>harmonia</b> in the <i>Anonymus</i>, and is equivalent
to <b>tonos</b>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 14. <i>Recapitulation&mdash; harmonia and tonos.</i></h2>

<p>The inquiry has now reached a stage at which we
may stop to consider what result has been reached,
especially in regard to the question whether the two
words <b>harmonia</b> and <b>tonos</b> denote two sets of musical
forms, or are merely two different names for the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
thing. The latter alternative appears to be supported
by several considerations.</p>

<p>1. From various passages, especially in Plato and
Aristotle, it has been shown that the modes anciently
called <b>harmoniai</b> differed in pitch, and that this difference
in pitch was regarded as the chief source of the peculiar
ethical character of the modes.</p>

<p>2. The list of <b>harmoniai</b> as gathered from the writers
who treat of them, viz. Plato, Aristotle, and Heraclides
Ponticus, is substantially the same as the list of <b>tonoi</b>
described by Aristoxenus (<a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>): and moreover, there
is an agreement in detail between the two lists which
cannot be purely accidental. Thus Heraclides says
that certain people had found out a new <b>harmonia</b>, the
Hypo-phrygian; and Aristoxenus speaks of the Hypo-phrygian
<b>tonos</b> as a comparatively new one. Again, the
account which Aristoxenus gives of the Hypo-dorian
<b>tonos</b> as a key immediately below the Dorian agrees
with what Heraclides says of the Hypo-dorian <b>harmonia</b>,
and also with the mention of Hypo-dorian and Hypo-phrygian
(but not Hypo-lydian) in the Aristotelian
<i>Problems</i>. Once more, the absence of Ionian from the
list of <b>tonoi</b> in Aristoxenus is an exception which proves
the rule: since the name of the Ionian <b>harmonia</b> is
similarly absent from Aristotle.</p>

<p>3. The usage of the words <b>harmonia</b> and <b>tonos</b> is never
such as to suggest that they refer to different things.
In the earlier writers, down to and including Aristotle,
<b>harmonia</b> is used, never <b>tonos</b>. In Aristoxenus and his
school we find <b>tonos</b>, and in later writers <b>tropos</b>, but
not <b>harmonia</b>. The few writers (such as Plutarch) who
use both <b>tonos</b> and <b>harmonia</b> do not observe any consistent
distinction between them. Those who (like Westphal)
believe that there was a distinction, are obliged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
admit that <b>harmonia</b> is occasionally used for <b>tonos</b> and
conversely.</p>

<p>4. If a series of names such as Dorian, Phrygian,
Lydian and the rest were applied to two sets of things
so distinct from each other, and at the same time so
important in the practice of music, as what we now call
modes and keys, it is incredible that there should be
no trace of the double usage. Yet our authors show no
sense even of possible ambiguity. Indeed, they seem
to prefer, in referring to modes or keys, to use the
adverbial forms <b>dôristi</b>, <b>phrygisti</b>, &amp;c., or the neuter
<b>ta dôria</b>, <b>ta phrygia</b>, &amp;c., where there is nothing to show
whether 'mode' or 'key,' <b>harmonia</b> or <b>tonos</b>, is intended.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 15. <i>The Systems of Greek Music.</i></h2>

<p>The arguments in favour of identifying the primitive
national Modes (<b>harmoniai</b>) with the <b>tonoi</b> or keys may
be reinforced by some considerations drawn from the
history and use of another ancient term, namely
<b>systêma</b>.</p>

<p>A System (<b>systêma</b>) is defined by the Greek technical
writers as a group or complex of intervals (<b>to ek pleionôn
ê henos diastêmatôn synkeimenon</b> Ps. Eucl.). That is
to say, any three or more notes whose <i>relative</i> pitch
is fixed may be regarded as forming a particular
System. If the notes are such as might be used in
the same melody, they are said to form a <i>musical</i>
System (<b>systêma emmeles</b>). As a matter of abstract
theory it is evident that there are very many combinations
of intervals which in this sense form a musical
System. In fact, however, the variety of systems recognised
in the theory of Greek music was strictly limited.
The notion of a small number of scales, of a particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
compass, available for the use of the musician,
was naturally suggested by the ancient lyre, with its
fixed and conventional number of strings. The word
for <i>string</i> (<b>chordê</b>) came to be used with the general
sense of a <i>note</i> of music; and in this way the several
strings of the lyre gave their names to the notes of the
Greek gamut<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 16. <i>The Standard Octachord System.</i></h2>

<p>In the age of the great melic poets the lyre had no
more than seven strings: but the octave was completed
in the earliest times of which we have accurate information.
The scale which is assumed as matter of
common knowledge in the Aristotelian <i>Problems</i> and
the <i>Harmonics</i> of Aristoxenus consists of eight notes,
named as follows from their place on the lyre:</p>

<p>
&emsp;&emsp;Nêtê&emsp;(<b>neatê</b> or <b>nêtê</b>, lit. 'lowest,' our 'highest').<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Paranêtê&emsp;(<b>paranêtê</b>, 'next to Nêtê').<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Tritê&emsp;(<b>tritê</b>, <i>i.e.</i> 'third' string).<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Paramesê&emsp;(<b>paramesê</b> or <b>paramesos</b>, 'next to Mesê').<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Mesê&emsp;(<b>mesê</b>, 'middle string').<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Lichanos&emsp;(<b>lichanos</b>, <i>i.e.</i> 'forefinger' string).<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Parhypatê&emsp;(<b>parypatê</b>).<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Hypatê&emsp;(<b>hypatê</b>, lit. 'uppermost,' our 'lowest').<br />
</p>

<p>It will be seen that the conventional sense of high
and low in the words <b>hypatê</b> and <b>neatê</b> was the reverse
of the modern usage.</p>

<p>The musical scale formed by these eight notes consists
of two <i>tetrachords</i> or scales of four notes, and a
major tone. The lower of the tetrachords consists of
the notes from Hypatê to Mesê, the higher of those
from Paramesê to Nêtê: the interval between Mesê
and Paramesê being the so-called <i>Disjunctive Tone</i>
(<b>tonos diazeuktikos</b>). Within each tetrachord the intervals
depend upon the <i>Genus</i> (<b>genos</b>). Thus the four
notes just mentioned&mdash;Hypatê, Mesê, Paramesê, Nêtê&mdash;are
the same for every genus, and accordingly are
called the 'standing' or 'immoveable' notes (<b>phthongoi
hestôtes, akinêtoi</b>), while the others vary with the genus,
and are therefore 'moveable' (<b>pheromenoi</b>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>In the ordinary Diatonic genus the intervals of the
tetrachords are, in the ascending order, semitone + tone
+ tone: <i>i.e.</i> Parhypatê is a semitone above Hypatê, and
Lichanos a tone above Parhypatê. In the Enharmonic
genus the intervals are two successive quarter-tones
(<b>diesis</b>) followed by a ditone or major Third: consequently
Parhypatê is only a quarter of a tone above
Hypatê, and Lichanos again a quarter of a tone above
Parhypatê. The group of three notes separated in this
way by small intervals (viz. two successive quarter-tones)
is called a <b>pyknon</b>. If we use an asterisk to
denote that a note is raised a quarter of a tone, these
two scales may be represented in modern notation as
follows:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/p_032.gif" width="524" height="273" alt="Pynknon" /></p>
<p style="font-size: 150%"><b>&pi;&mu;&kappa;&nu;&omicron;&nu;</b> = <b>pyknon</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Chromatic genus and its varieties the division
is of an intermediate kind. The interval between
Lichanos and Mesê is more than one tone, but less
than two: and the two other intervals, as in the enharmonic,
are equal.</p>

<p>The most characteristic feature of this scale, in
contrast to those of the modern Major and Minor,
is the place of the small intervals (semitone or <b>pyknon</b>),
which are always the lowest intervals of a tetrachord.
It is hardly necessary to quote passages from Aristotle
and Aristoxenus to show that this is the succession of
intervals assumed by them. The question is asked
in the Aristotelian <i>Problems</i> (xix. 4), why Parhypatê is
difficult to sing, while Hypatê is easy, although there is
only a diesis between them (<b>kaitoi diesis hekateras</b>).
Again (<i>Probl.</i> xix. 47), speaking of the old heptachord
scale, the writer says that the Paramesê was left out,
and consequently the Mesê became the lowest note
of the upper <b>pyknon</b>, <i>i.e.</i> the group of 'close' notes
consisting of Mesê, Tritê, and Paranêtê. Similarly
Aristoxenus (<i>Harm.</i> p. 23) observes that the 'space'
of the Lichanos, <i>i.e.</i> the limit within which it varies in
the different genera, is a tone while the space of the
Parhypatê is only a diesis, for it is never nearer Hypatê
than a diesis or further off than a semitone.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 17. <i>Earlier Heptachord Scales.</i></h2>

<p>Regarding the earlier seven-stringed scales which
preceded this octave our information is scanty and
somewhat obscure. The chief notice on the subject
is the following passage of the Aristotelian <i>Problems</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Probl.</i> xix. 47 <b>dia ti hoi archaioi heptachordous poiountes tas
harmonias tên hypatên all' ou tên nêtên katelipon: hê ou tên</b>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<b>hypatên</b> (leg. <b>nêtên</b>), <b>alla tên nyn paramesên kaloumenên
aphêroun kai to toniaion diastêma; echrônto de tê eschatê mesê
tou epi to oxy pyknou; did kai mesên autên prosêloreusan [hê]
oti ên tou men anô tetrachordon teleutê, tou de katô archê, kai
meson eiche logon tonô tôn akrôn?</b></p>

<p>'Why did the ancient seven-stringed scales include
Hypatê but not Nêtê? Or should we say that the note
omitted was not Nêtê, but the present Paramesê and the
interval of a tone (<i>i.e.</i> the disjunctive tone)? The Mesê,
then, was the lowest note of the upper <b>pyknon</b>: whence the
name <b>mesê</b>, because it was the end of the upper tetrachord
and beginning of the lower one, and was in pitch the
middle between the extremes.'</p></blockquote>

<p>This clearly implies two conjunct tetrachords&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/p_048.gif" width="263" height="55" alt="tetrachord" /></p>

<p>In another place (<i>Probl.</i> xix. 32) the question is asked,
why the interval of the octave is called <b>dia pasôn</b>, not <b>di'
oktô</b>,&mdash;as the Fourth is <b>dia tessarôn</b>, the Fifth <b>dia pente</b>.
The answer suggested is that there were anciently seven
strings, and that Terpander left out the Tritê and added
the Nêtê. That is to say, Terpander increased the compass
of the scale from the ancient two tetrachords to
a full Octave; but he did not increase the number of
strings to eight. Thus he produced a scale like the
standard octave, but with one note wanting; so that
the term <b>di oktô</b> was inappropriate.</p>

<p>Among later writers who confirm this account we
may notice Nicomachus, p. 7 Meib. <b>mesê dia tessarôn
pros amphotera en tê heptachordô kata to palaion diestôsa</b>:
and p. 20 <b>tê toinyn archaiotropô lyra toutesti tê heptachordô,
kata synaphên ek duo tetrachordôn synestôsê k.t.l.</b></p>

<p>It appears then that two kinds of seven-stringed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
scales were known, at least by tradition: viz. (1) a scale
composed of two conjunct tetrachords, and therefore
of a compass less than an octave by one tone; and
(2) a scale of the compass of an octave, but wanting
a note, viz. the note above Mesê. The existence of
this incomplete scale is interesting as a testimony to
the force of the tradition which limited the number of
strings to seven.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 18. <i>The Perfect System.</i></h2>

<p>The term 'Perfect System' (<b>systêma teleion</b>) is
applied by the technical writers to a scale which is
evidently formed by successive additions to the heptachord
and octachord scales explained in the preceding
chapter. It may be described as a combination of two
scales, called the Greater and Lesser Perfect System.</p>

<p>The Greater Perfect System (<b>systêma teleion meizon</b>)
consists of two octaves formed from the primitive
octachord System by adding a tetrachord at each end
of the scale. The new notes are named like those of
the adjoining tetrachord of the original octave, but with
the name of the tetrachord added by way of distinction.
Thus below the original Hypatê we have a new tetrachord
Hypatôn (<b>tetrachordon hypatôn</b>), the notes of which
are accordingly called Hypatê Hypatôn, Parhypatê
Hypatôn, and Lichanos Hypatôn: and similarly above
Nêtê we have a tetrachord Hyperbolaiôn. Finally the
octave downwards from Mesê is completed by the addition
of a note appropriately called Proslambanomenos.</p>

<p>The Lesser Perfect System (<b>systêma teleion elasson</b>)
is apparently based upon the ancient heptachord which
consisted of two 'conjunct' tetrachords meeting in the
Mesê. This scale was extended downwards in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
same way as the Greater System, and thus became
a scale of three tetrachords and a tone.</p>

<p>These two Systems together constitute the Perfect
and 'unmodulating' System (<b>systêma teleion ametabolon</b>),
which may be represented in modern notation<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No account of the Perfect System is given by
Aristoxenus, and there is no trace in his writings of
an extension of the standard scale beyond the limits
of the original octave. In one place indeed (<i>Harm.</i>
p. 8, 12 Meib.) Aristoxenus promises to treat of Systems,
'and among them of the perfect System' (<b>peri te
tôn allôn kai tou teleiou</b>). But we cannot assume that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the phrase here had the technical sense which it bore
in later writers. More probably it meant simply the
octave scale, in contrast to the tetrachord and pentachord&mdash;a
sense in which it is used by Aristides
Quintilianus, p. 11 Meib. <b>synêmmenôn de eklêthê to holon
systêma hoti tô prokeimenô teleiô tô mechri mesês synêptai</b>,
'the whole scale was called conjunct because it
is conjoined to the complete scale that reaches up to
Mesê' (<i>i.e.</i> the octave extending from Proslambanomenos
to Mesê). So p. 16 <b>kai ha men autôn esti teleia,
ha d' ou, atelê men tetrachordon, pentachordon, teleion de oktachordon.</b>
This is a use of <b>teleios</b> which is likely enough
to have come from Aristoxenus. The word was doubtless
applied in each period to the most complete scale
which musical theory had then recognised.</p>

<p>Little is known of the steps by which this enlargement
of the Greek scale was brought about. We shall
not be wrong in conjecturing that it was connected
with the advance made from time to time in the form
and compass of musical instruments<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.
Along with the lyre, which kept its primitive simplicity as the instrument
of education and everyday use, the Greeks had
the cithara (<b>kithara</b>), an enlarged and improved lyre,
which, to judge from the representations on ancient
monuments, was generally seen in the hands of professional
players (<b>kitharôdoi</b>). The development of the
cithara showed itself in the increase, of which we have
good evidence even before the time of Plato, in the
number of the strings. The poet Ion, the contemporary
of Sophocles, was the author of an epigram on a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
ten-stringed lyre, which seems to have had a scale
closely approaching that of the Lesser Perfect System<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.
A little later we hear of the comic poet Pherecrates
attacking the musician Timotheus for various innovations
tending to the loss of primitive simplicity, in
particular the use of twelve strings<a name="FNanchor_2_12" id="FNanchor_2_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.
According to a tradition mentioned by Pausanias, the Spartans condemned
Timotheus because in his cithara he had added
four strings to the ancient seven. The offending instrument
was hung up in the Scias (the place of meeting
of the Spartan assembly), and apparently was seen
there by Pausanias himself (Paus. iii. 12, 8).</p>

<p>A similar or still more rapid development took place
in the flute (<b>aulos</b>). The flute-player Pronomus of
Thebes, who was said to have been one of the instructors
of Alcibiades, invented a flute on which it was
possible to play in all the modes. 'Up to his time,'
says Pausanias (ix. 12, 5), 'flute-players had three
forms of flute: with one they played Dorian music;
a different set of flutes served for the Phrygian mode
(<b>harmonia</b>); and the so-called Lydian was played on
another kind again. Pronomus was the first who
devised flutes fitted for every sort of mode, and played
melodies different in mode on the same flute.' The
use of the new invention soon became general, since in
Plato's time the flute was the instrument most distinguished
by the multiplicity of its notes: cp. Rep. p. 399
<b>ti de? aulopoious ê aulêtas paradexei eis tên polin? ê ou
touto polychordotaton?</b> Plato may have had the invention
of Pronomus in mind when he wrote these words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the order in which the new notes
obtained a place in the schemes of theoretical musicians
we have no trustworthy information. The name <b>proslambanomenos</b>,
applied to the lowest note of the Perfect
System, points to a time when it was the last new
addition to the scale. Plutarch in his work on the
<i>Timaeus</i> of Plato (<b>peri tês en Timaiô psychogonias</b>) speaks
of the Proslambanomenos as having been added in comparatively
recent times (p. 1029 <i>c</i> <b>hoi de neôteroi ton proslambanomenon
tonô diapheronta tês hypatês epi to bary
taxantes to men holon diastêma dis dia pasôn epoiêsan</b>).
The rest of the Perfect System he ascribes to 'the
ancients' (<b>tous palaious ismen hypatas men dyo, treis de
nêtas, mian de mesên kai mian paramesên tithemenous</b>). An
earlier addition&mdash;perhaps the first made to the primitive
octave&mdash;was a note called Hyperhypatê, which was
a tone below the old Hypatê, in the place afterwards
occupied on the Diatonic scale by Lichanos Hypatôn.
It naturally disappeared when the tetrachord Hypatôn
came into use. It is only mentioned by one author,
Thrasyllus (quoted by Theon Smyrnaeus, cc. 35-36<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>The notes of the Perfect System, with the intervals
of the scale which they formed, are fully set out in the
two treatises that pass under the name of the geometer
Euclid, viz. the <i>Introductio Harmonica</i> and the <i>Sectio
Canonis</i>. Unfortunately the authorship of both these
works is doubtful<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.
All that we can say is that if the
Perfect System was elaborated in the brief interval
between the time of Aristotle and that of Euclid, the
materials for it must have already existed in musical
practice.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 19. <i>Relation of System and Key.</i></h2>

<p>Let us now consider the relation between this fixed
or standard scale and the varieties denoted by the
terms <b>harmonia</b> and <b>tonos</b>.</p>

<p>With regard to the <b>tonoi</b> or Keys of Aristoxenus we
are not left in doubt. A system, as we have seen, is
a series of notes whose <i>relative</i> pitch is fixed. The
key in which the System is taken fixes the absolute
pitch of the series. As Aristoxenus expresses it, the
Systems are melodies set at the pitch of the different
keys (<b>tous tonous, eph' hôn tithemena ta systêmata melôdeitai</b>).
If then we speak of Hypatê or Mesê (just as
when we speak of a moveable Do), we mean as many
different notes as there are keys: but the Dorian
Hypatê or the Lydian Mesê has an ascertained pitch.
The Keys of Aristoxenus, in short, are so many transpositions
of the scale called the Perfect System.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Such being the relation of the standard System to
the key, can we suppose any different relation to have
subsisted between the standard System and the ancient
'modes' known to Plato and Aristotle under the name
of <b>harmoniai</b>?</p>

<p>It appears from the language used by Plato in the
<i>Republic</i> that Greek musical instruments differed very
much in the variety of modes or <b>harmoniai</b> of which they
were susceptible. After Socrates has determined, in
the passage quoted above (p. 7), that he will admit
only two modes, the Dorian and Phrygian, he goes
on to observe that the music of his state will not need
a multitude of strings, or an instrument of all the modes
(<b>panarmonion</b>)<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.
'There will be no custom therefore for
craftsmen who make triangles and harps and other
instruments of many notes and many modes. How
then about makers of the flute (<b>aulos</b>) and players on
the flute? Has not the flute the greatest number of
notes, and are not the scales which admit all the modes
simply imitations of the flute? There remain then
the lyre and the cithara for use in our city; and for
shepherds in the country a syrinx (pan's pipes).' The
lyre, it is plain, did not admit of changes of mode.
The seven or eight strings were tuned to furnish the
scale of one mode, not of more. What then is the
relation between the mode or <b>harmonia</b> of a lyre and the
standard scale or <b>systêma</b> which (as we have seen) was
based upon the lyre and its primitive gamut?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>If <b>harmonia</b> means 'key,' there is no difficulty. The
scale of a lyre was usually the standard octave from
Hypatê to Nêtê: and that octave might be in any one
key. But if a mode is somehow characterised by a
particular succession of intervals, what becomes of the
standard octave? No one succession of intervals can
then be singled out. It may be said that the standard
octave is in fact the scale of a particular mode, which
had come to be regarded as the type, viz. the Dorian.
But there is no trace of any such prominence of the
Dorian mode as this would necessitate. The philosophers
who recognise its elevation and Hellenic purity are very
far from implying that it had the chief place in popular
regard. Indeed the contrary was evidently the case<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a>

<h2>§ 20. <i>Tonality of the Greek musical scale.</i></h2>

<p>It may be said here that the value of a series of notes
as the basis of a distinct mode&mdash;in the modern sense of
the word&mdash;depends essentially upon the <i>tonality</i>. A
single scale might yield music of different modes if the
key-note were different. It is necessary therefore to
collect the scanty notices which we possess bearing
upon the tonality of Greek music. The chief evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
on the subject is a passage of the <i>Problems</i>, the importance
of which was first pointed out by Helmholtz<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p>It is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Arist. <i>Probl.</i> xix. 20: <b>Dia ti ean men tis tên mesên kinêsê

<p>'Why is it that if the Mesê is altered, after the other
strings have been tuned, the instrument is felt to be out
of tune, not only when the Mesê is sounded, but through
the whole of the music,&mdash;whereas if the Lichanos or any
other note is out of tune, it seems to be perceived only
when that note is struck? Is it to be explained on the
ground that all good melodies often use the Mesê, and all
good composers resort to it frequently, and if they leave it
soon return again, but do not make the same use of any
other note? just as language cannot be Greek if certain
conjunctions are omitted, such as <b>te</b> and <b>kai</b>, while others
may be dispensed with, because the one class is necessary
for language, but not the other: so with musical sounds
the Mesê is a kind of 'conjunction,' especially of beautiful
sounds, since it is most often heard among these.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>In another place (xix. 36) the question is answered by
saying that the notes of a scale stand in a certain relation
to the Mesê, which determines them with reference
to it (<b>hê taxis hê hekastês êdê di' ekeinên</b>): so that the loss
of the Mesê means the loss of the ground and unifying
element of the scale (<b>arthentos tou aitiou tou hêrmosthai kai
tou synechontos</b>)<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>These passages imply that in the scale known to
Aristotle, viz. the octave <i>e-e</i>, the Mesê <i>a</i> had the
character of a Tonic or key-note. This must have
been true <i>a fortiori</i> of the older seven-stringed scale,
in which the Mesê united the two conjunct tetrachords.
It was quite in accordance with this state of things
that the later enlargement completed the octaves from
Mesê downwards and upwards, so that the scale
consisted of two octaves of the form <i>a-a</i>. As to the
question how the Tonic character of the Mesê was
shown, in what parts of the melody it was necessarily
heard, and the like, we can but guess. The statement
of the <i>Problems</i> is not repeated by any technical writer,
and accordingly it does not appear that any rules on
the subject had been arrived at. It is significant,
perhaps, that the frequent use of the Mesê is spoken
of as characteristic of <i>good</i> melody (<b>panta ta chrêsta
melê pollakis tê mesê chrêtai</b>), as though tonality were
a merit rather than a necessity.</p>

<p>Another passage of the <i>Problems</i> has been thought to
show that in Greek music the melody ended on the
Hypatê. The words are these (<i>Probl.</i> xix. 33):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Dia ti euarmostoteron apo tou oxeos epi to bary ê apo tou</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p><b>bareos epi to oxy; poteron hoti to apo tês archês ginetai archesthai?
hê gar mesê kai hêgemôn oxytatê tou tetrachordou; to de
ouk ap' archês all' apo teleutês.</b></p>

<p>'Why is a descending scale more musical than an
ascending one? Is it that in this order we begin with
the beginning,&mdash;since the Mesê or leading note<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
is the highest of the tetrachord,&mdash;but with the reverse order
we begin with the end?'</p>

<p>There is here no explicit statement that the melody
ended on the Hypatê, or even that it began with the
Mesê. In what sense, then, was the Mesê a 'beginning'
(<b>archê</b>), and the Hypatê an 'end'? In Aristotelian
language the word <b>archê</b> has various senses. It might
be used to express the relation of the Mesê to the other
notes as the basis or ground-work of the scale. Other
passages, however, point to a simpler explanation, viz.
that the order in question was merely conventional. In
<i>Probl.</i> xix. 44 it is said that the Mesê is the beginning
(<b>archê</b>) of one of the two tetrachords which form the
ordinary octave scale (viz. the tetrachord Mesôn); and
again in <i>Probl.</i> xix. 47 that in the old heptachord which
consisted of two conjunct tetrachords (<i>e-a-d</i>) the
Mesê (<i>a</i>) was the end of the upper tetrachord and the
beginning of the lower one (<b>hoti ên tou men anô tetrachordou
teleutê, tou de katô archê</b>). In this last passage
it is evident that there is no reference to the beginning
or end of the melody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Another instance of the use of <b>archê</b> in connexion with
the musical scale is to be found in the <i>Metaphysics</i>
(iv. 11, p. 1018 <i>b</i> 26), where Aristotle is speaking of the
different senses in which things may be prior and
posterior:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Ta de kata taxin; tauta d' estin hosa pros ti hen hôrismenon
diestêke kata ton logon, hoion parastatês tritostatou proteron,
kai paranêtê nêtês; entha men gar ho koryphaios, entha de hê mesê
archê.</b></p>

<p>'Other things [are prior and posterior] in <i>order</i>: viz.
those which are at a varying interval from some one
definite thing; as the second man in the rank is prior to
the third man, and the Paranêtê to the Nêtê: for in the
one case the coryphaeus is the starting-point, in the other
the Mesê.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the Mesê is again the <b>archê</b> or beginning, but
the order is the ascending one, and consequently the
Nêtê is the end. The passage confirms what we have
learned of the relative importance of the Mesê: but it
certainly negatives any inference regarding the note on
which the melody ended.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that the Mesê of the Greek standard
System had the functions of a key-note in that System.
In other words, the music was in the <i>mode</i> (using
that term in the modern sense) represented by the
octave <i>a-a</i> of the natural key&mdash;the Hypo-dorian or
Common Species. We do not indeed know how the
predominant character of the Mesê was shown&mdash;whether,
for example, the melody ended on the Mesê.
The supposed evidence for an ending on the Hypatê
has been shown to be insufficient. But we may at
least hold that as far as the Mesê was a key-note, so
far the Greek scale was that of the modern Minor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
mode (descending). The only way of escape from this
conclusion is to deny that the Mesê of <i>Probl.</i> xix. 20
was the note which we have understood by the term&mdash;the
Mesê of the standard System. This, as we shall
presently see, is the plea to which Westphal has
recourse.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 21. <i>The Species of a Scale.</i></h2>

<p>The object of the preceding discussion has been to
make it clear that the theory of a system of modes&mdash;in
the modern sense of the word&mdash;finds no support
from the earlier authorities on Greek music. There
is, however, evidence to show that Aristoxenus, and
perhaps other writers of the time, gave much thought
to the varieties to be obtained by taking the intervals of
a scale in different order. These varieties they spoke
of as the <i>forms</i> or <i>species</i> (<b>schêmata, eidê</b>) of the interval
which measured the compass of the scale in question.
Thus, the interval of the Octave (<b>dia pasôn</b>) is divided
into seven intervals, and these are, in the Diatonic
genus, five tones and two semitones, in the Enharmonic
two ditones, four quarter-tones, and a tone. As we
shall presently see in detail, there are seven species of
the Octave in each genus. That is to say, there are
seven admissible octachord scales (<b>systêmata emmelê</b>),
differing only in the succession of the intervals which
compose them.</p>

<p>Further, there is evidence which goes to connect the
seven species of the Octave with the Modes or <b>harmoniai</b>.
In some writers these species are described under
names which are familiar to us in their application
to the modes. A certain succession of intervals is
called the Dorian species of the Octave, another succession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
is called the Phrygian species, and so on for
the Lydian, Mixo-lydian, Hypo-dorian, Hypo-phrygian,
and Hypo-lydian. It seems natural to conclude that
the species or successions of intervals so named were
characteristic in some way of the modes which bore the
same names, consequently that the modes were not keys,
but modes in the modern sense of the term.</p>

<p>In order to estimate the value of this argument, it is
necessary to ask, (1) how far back we can date the use
of these names for the species of the Octave, and (2) in
what degree the species of the Octave can be shown to
have entered into the practice of music at any period.
The answer to these questions must be gathered from
a careful examination of all that Aristoxenus and other
early writers say of the different musical scales in
reference to the order of their intervals.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 22. <i>The Scales as treated by Aristoxenus.</i></h2>

<p>The subject of the musical scales (<b>systêmata</b>) is
treated by Aristoxenus as a general problem, without
reference to the scales in actual use. He complains
that his predecessors dealt only with the octave scale,
and only with the Enharmonic genus, and did not
address themselves to the real question of the melodious
sequence of intervals. Accordingly, instead of beginning
with a particular scale, such as the octave, he supposes
a scale of indefinite compass,&mdash;just as a mathematician
postulates lines and surfaces of unlimited magnitude.
His problem virtually is, given any interval known
to the particular genus supposed, to determine what
intervals can follow it on a musical scale, either ascending
or descending. In the Diatonic genus, for example,
a semitone must be followed by two tones, so as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
make up the interval of a Fourth. In the Enharmonic
genus the dieses or quarter-tones can only occur two
together, and every such pair of dieses (<b>pyknon</b>) must
be followed in the ascending order by a ditone, in the
descending order by a ditone or a tone. By these and
similar rules, which he deduces mathematically from
one or two general principles of melody, Aristoxenus in
effect determines all the possible scales of each genus,
without restriction of compass or pitch<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.
But whenever he refers for the purpose of illustration to a scale in
actual use, it is always the standard octave already
described (from Hypatê to Nêtê), or a part of it. Thus
nothing can be clearer than the distinction which he
makes between the theoretically infinite scale, subject
only to certain principles or laws determining the
succession of intervals, and the eight notes, of fixed
relative pitch, which constituted the gamut of practical
music.</p>

<p>The passages in which Aristoxenus dwells upon the
advance which he has made upon the methods of his
predecessors are of considerable importance for the
whole question of the species of the Octave. There
are three or four places which it will be worth while to
quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. Aristoxenus, <i>Harm.</i> p. 2, 15 Meib.: <b>ta gar diagrammata

<blockquote>
<p>'The diagrams of the earlier writers set forth Systems
in the Enharmonic genus only, never in the Diatonic or
Chromatic: and yet these diagrams professed to give the
whole scheme of their music, and in them they treated of
Enharmonic octave Systems only; of other genera and
other forms of this or any genus no one attempted to
discover anything.'</p>

<p>2. Ibid. p. 6, 20 Meib.: <b>tôn d' allôn katholou men kathaper

<p>'The other Systems no one has dealt with by a general
method: but Eratocles has attempted in the case of one
System, in one genus, to enumerate the forms or <i>species</i> of
the Octave, and to determine them mathematically by the
periodic recurrence of the intervals: not perceiving that
unless we have first demonstrated the forms of the Fifth
and the Fourth, and the manner of their melodious combination,
the forms of the Octave will come to be many
more than seven.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 'periodic recurrence of intervals' here spoken of
may be illustrated on the key-board of a piano. If we
take successive octaves of white notes, <i>a-a</i>, <i>b-b</i>, and
so on, we obtain each time a different order of intervals
(<i>i.e.</i> the semitones occur in different places), until we
reach <i>a-a</i> again, when the series begins afresh. In
this way it is shown that only seven species of the
Octave can be found on any particular scale. Aristoxenus
shows how to prove this from first principles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
viz. by analysing the Octave as the combination of
a Fifth with a Fourth.</p>

<p>3. Ibid. p. 36, 29 Meib.: <b>tôn de systêmatôn tas diaphoras
hoi men holôs ouk epecheiroun exarithmein, alla peri autôn monon
tôn heptachordôn ha ekaloun harmonias tên episkepsin epoiounto, hoi

<p>For <b>heptachordôn</b> Meibomius and other editors read
<b>hepta oktachordôn</b>&mdash;a correction strongly suggested by
the parallel words <b>systêmatôn oktachordôn</b> in the first
passage quoted.</p>

<p>'Some did not attempt to enumerate the differences of
the Systems, but confined their view to the seven octachord
Systems which they called <b>harmoniai</b>; others who did make
the attempt did not succeed.'</p>

<p>It appears from these passages that before the time
of Aristoxenus musicians had framed diagrams or tables
showing the division of the octave scale according to
the Enharmonic genus: and that a certain Eratocles&mdash;of
whom nothing else is known&mdash;had recognised seven
forms or species of the octachord scale, and had shown
how the order of the intervals in the several species
passes through a sort of cycle. Finally, if the correction
proposed in the third passage is right, the seven species
of the Octave were somehow shown in the diagrams
of which the first passage speaks. In what respect
Eratocles failed in his treatment of the seven species
can hardly be conjectured.</p>

<p>Elsewhere the diagrams are described by Aristoxenus
somewhat differently, as though they exhibited a division
into Enharmonic dieses or quarter-tones, without reference
to the melodious character of the scale. Thus we find him saying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>Harm.</i> p. 28 Meib.: <b>zêtêteon de to syneches ouch hôs hoi

<p>'We must seek continuity of succession, not as theoretical
musicians do in filling up their diagrams with small intervals,
making those notes successive which are separated from
each other by the least interval. For it is not merely that
the voice cannot sing twenty-eight successive dieses: with
all its efforts it cannot sing a third diesis<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.'</p>

<p>This representation of the musical diagrams is borne
out by the passage in the <i>Republic</i> in which Plato
derides the experimental study of music:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rep.</i> p. 531 a <b>tas gar akouomenas au symphônias kai phthongous

hoi men phasin eti katakouein en mesô tina êchên kai smikrotaton
einai touto diastêma, hô metrêteon, hoi de k.t.l.</b></p>

<p>Here Socrates is insisting that the theory of music
should be studied as a branch of mathematics, not by
observation of the sounds and concords actually heard,
about which musicians spend toil in vain. 'Yes,' says
Glaucon, 'they talk of the close-fitting of intervals, and
put their ears down to listen for the smallest possible
interval, which is then to be the measure.' The smallest
interval was of course the Enharmonic diesis or quarter
of a tone, and this accordingly was the measure or unit
into which the scale was divided. A group of notes
separated by a diesis was called 'close' (<b>pyknon</b>, or
a <b>pyknôma</b>), and the filling up of the scale in that way
was therefore a <b>katapyknôsis tou diagrammatos</b>&mdash;a filling
up with 'close-set' notes, by the division of every tone
into four equal parts.</p>

<p>An example of a diagram of this kind has perhaps
survived in a comparatively late writer, viz. Aristides
Quintilianus, who gives a scale of two octaves, one
divided into twenty-four dieses, the next into twelve
semitones (<i>De Mus.</i> p. 15 Meib.). The characters used
are not otherwise known, being quite different from the
ordinary notation: but the nature of the diagram is
plain from the accompanying words: <b>hautê estin hê para
tois archaiois kata dieseis harmonia, heôs &kappa;&delta; dieseôn to proteron
diagousa dia pasôn, to deuteron dia tôn hêmitoniôn
auxêsasa</b>: 'this is the <b>harmonia</b> (division of the scale)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
according to dieses in use among the ancients, carried
in the case of the first octave as far as twenty-four
dieses, and dividing the second into semitones<a name="FNanchor_1_22" id="FNanchor_1_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.'</p>

<p>The phrase <b>hê kata dieseis harmonia</b>, used for the division
of an octave scale into quarter-tones, serves to
explain the statement of Aristoxenus (in the third of
the passages above quoted) that the writers who treated
of octave Systems called them 'harmonies' (<b>ha ekaloun
harmonias</b>). That statement has usually been taken to
refer to the ancient Modes called <b>harmoniai</b> by Plato and
Aristotle, and has been used accordingly as proof that
the scales of these Modes were based upon the different
species (<b>eidê</b>) of the Octave. But the form of the reference&mdash;'which
<i>they called</i> <b>harmoniai</b>'&mdash;implies some forgotten
or at least unfamiliar use of the word by the
older technical writers. It is very much more probable
that the <b>harmoniai</b> in question are divisions of the
octave scale, as shown in theoretical diagrams, and had
no necessary connexion with the Modes. Apparently
some at least of these diagrams were not musical scales,
but tables of all the notes in the compass of an octave;
and the Enharmonic diesis was used, not merely on
account of the importance of that genus, but because it
was the smallest interval, and therefore the natural unit
of measurement<a name="FNanchor_2_23" id="FNanchor_2_23"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The use of <b>harmonia</b> as an equivalent for 'System' or
'division of the scale' appears in an important passage
in Plato's <i>Philebus</i> (p. 17): <b>all', ô phile, epeidan labês ta
diastêmata hoposa esti ton arithmon tês phônês oxytêtos te
peri kai barytêtos, kai hopoia, kai tous horous tôn diastêmatôn,
kai ta ek toutôn hosa systêmata gegonen, ha
katidontes hoi prosthen paredosan hêmin tois hepomenois ekeinois
kalein auta harmonias, k.t.l.</b> In this passage,&mdash;which
has an air of technical accuracy not usual in Plato's
references to music (though perhaps characteristic of the
<i>Philebus</i>),&mdash;there is a close agreement with the technical
writers, especially Aristoxenus. The main thought is
the application of limit or measure to matter which is
given as unlimited or indefinite&mdash;the distinction drawn
out by Aristoxenus in a passage quoted below (<a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a>).
The treatment of the term 'System' is notably Aristoxenean
(cp. <i>Harm.</i> p. 36 <b>ta systêmata theôrêsai posa te
esti kai poia atta, kai pôs ek te tôn diastêmatôn kai
phthongôn synestêkota</b>). Further, the use of <b>harmonia</b> for
<b>systêma</b>, or rather of the plural <b>harmoniai</b> for the <b>systêmata</b>
observed by the older musical theorists, is exactly what
is noticed by Aristoxenus as if it were more or less
antiquated. Even in the time of Plato it appears as
a word of traditional character (<b>hoi prosthen paredosan</b>),
his own word being <b>systêma</b>. It need not be said that
there is no such hesitation, either in Plato or in Aristotle,
about the use of <b>harmoniai</b> for the modes.</p>

<p>The same use of <b>harmonia</b> is found in the Aristotelian
<i>Problems</i> (xix. 26), where the question is asked, <b>dia ti
mesê kaleitai en tais harmoniais, tôn de oktô ouk esti meson</b>,
<i>i.e.</i> how can we speak of the Mesê or 'middle note'
of a scale of eight notes?</p>

<p>We have now reviewed all the passages in Aristoxenus
which can be thought to bear upon the question
whether the <b>harmoniai</b> or Modes of early Greek

music are the same as the <b>tonoi</b> or Keys discussed by
Aristoxenus himself. The result seems to be that we
have found nothing to set against the positive arguments
for the identification already urged. It may be
thought, perhaps, that the variety of senses ascribed to
the word <b>harmonia</b> goes beyond what is probable. In
itself however the word meant simply 'musical scale<a name="FNanchor_1_24" id="FNanchor_1_24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.'
The Pythagorean use of it in the sense of 'octave
scale,' and the very similar use in reference to diagrams
which represented the division of that scale, were antiquated
in the time of Aristoxenus. The sense of
'key' was doubtless limited in the first instance to the
use in conjunction with the names Dorian, &amp;c., which
suggested a distinction of pitch. From the meaning
'Dorian scale' to 'Dorian key' is an easy step. Finally,
in reference to genus <b>harmonia</b> meant the Enharmonic
scale. It is not surprising that a word with so many
meanings did not keep its place in technical language,
but was replaced by unambiguous words, viz. <b>tonos</b> in
one sense, <b>systêma</b> in another, <b>genos enarmonion</b> in
a third. Naturally, too, the more precise terms would
be first employed by technical writers.</p>

<h2>§ 23. <i>The Seven Species.</i></h2>

<p>(<a href="#Page_127">See the Appendix, Table I.</a>)</p>

<p>In the <i>Harmonics</i> of Aristoxenus an account of the
seven species of the Octave followed the elaborate
theory of Systems already referred to (<a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>), and
doubtless exhibited the application of that general theory
to the particular cases of the Fourth, Fifth, and Octave.
Unfortunately the existing manuscripts have only
preserved the first few lines of this chapter of the
Aristoxenean work (p. 74, ll. 10-24 Meib.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The next source from which we learn anything of
this part of the subject is the pseudo-Euclidean <i>Introductio
Harmonica</i>. The writer enumerates the species
of the Fourth, the Fifth, and the Octave, first in the
Enharmonic and then in the Diatonic genus. He
shows that if we take Fourths on a Diatonic scale,
beginning with Hypatê Hypatôn (our <i>b</i>), we get successively
<i>b c d e</i> (a scale with the intervals &frac12; 1 1),
<i>c d e f</i> (1 1 &frac12;) and <i>d e f g</i> (1 &frac12; 1). Similarly on the
Enharmonic scale we get&mdash;</p>

<p>In the case of the Octave the species is distinguished
on the Enharmonic scale by the place of the tone which
separates the tetrachords, the so-called Disjunctive Tone
(<b>tonos diazeuktikos</b>). Thus in the octave from Hypatê
Hypatôn to Paramesê (<i>b-b</i>) this tone (<i>a-b</i>) is the
highest interval; in the next octave, from Parhypatê
Hypatôn to Tritê Diezeugmenôn (<i>c-c</i>), it is the second
highest; and so on. These octaves, or species of the
Octave, the writer goes on to tell us, were anciently
called by the same names as the seven oldest Keys, as
follows:</p>

<p>On the Diatonic scale, according to the same writer,
the species of an Octave is distinguished by the places
of the two semitones. Thus in the first species, <i>b-b</i>,
the semitones are the first and fourth intervals (<i>b-c</i>
and <i>e-f</i>): in the second, <i>c-c</i>, they are the third and
the seventh, and so on. He does not however say,
as he does in the case of the Enharmonic scale, that
these species were known by the names of the Keys.
This statement is first made by Gaudentius (p. 20 Meib.),
a writer of unknown date. If we adopt it provisionally,
the species of the Diatonic octave will be as follows:</p>

<h2>§ 24. <i>Relation of the Species to the Keys.</i></h2>

<p>Looking at the octaves which on our key-board, as
on the Greek scale, exhibit the several species, we
cannot but be struck with the peculiar relation in which
they stand to the Keys. In the tables given above the
keys stand in the order of their pitch, from the Mixo-lydian
down to the Hypo-dorian: the species of the
same names follow the reverse order, from <i>b-b</i> upwards
to <i>a-a</i>. This, it is obvious, cannot be an
accidental coincidence. The two uses of this famous
series of names cannot have originated independently.
Either the naming of the species was founded on that
of the keys, or the converse relation obtained between
them. Which of these two uses, then, was the original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and which the derived one? Those who hold that the
species were the basis of the ancient Modes or <b>harmoniai</b>
must regard the keys as derivative. Now Aristoxenus
tells us, in one of the passages just quoted, that the
seven species had long been recognised by theorists.
If the scheme of keys was founded upon the seven
species, it would at once have been complete, both in
the number of the keys and in the determination of the
intervals between them. But Aristoxenus also tells us
that down to his time there were only six keys,&mdash;one
of them not yet generally recognised,&mdash;and that their
relative pitch was not settled. Evidently then the
keys, which were scales in practical use, were still
incomplete when the species of the Octave had been
worked out in the theory of music.</p>

<p>If on the other hand we regard the names Dorian,
&amp;c. as originally applied to keys, we have only to
suppose that these names were extended to the species
after the number of seven keys had been completed.
This supposition is borne out by the fact that Aristoxenus,
who mentions the seven species as well known,
does not give them names, or connect them with the
keys. This step was apparently taken by some
follower of Aristoxenus, who wished to connect the
species of the older theorists with the system of keys
which Aristoxenus had perfected.</p>

<p>The view now taken of the seven species is supported
by the whole treatment of musical scales (<b>systêmata</b>) as
we find it in Aristoxenus. That treatment from first
to last is purely abstract and theoretical. The rules
which Aristoxenus lays down serve to determine the
sequence of intervals, but are not confined to scales of
any particular compass. His Systems, accordingly, are
not scales in practical use: they are parts taken anywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
on an ideal unlimited scale. And the seven
species of the Octave are regarded by Aristoxenus as
a scheme of the same abstract order. They represent
the earlier teaching on which he had improved. He
condemned that teaching for its want of generality,
because it was confined to the compass of the Octave
and to the Enharmonic genus, and also because it
rested on no principles that would necessarily limit
the species of the Octave to seven. On the other hand
the diagrams of the earlier musicians were unscientific,
in the opinion of Aristoxenus, on the ground that they
divided the scale into a succession of quarter-tones.
Such a division, he urged, is impossible in practice and
musically wrong (<b>ekmeles</b>). All this goes to show that
the earlier treatment of Systems, including the seven
Species, had the same theoretical character as his own
exposition. The only System which he recognises
for practical purposes is the old standard octave,
from Hypatê to Nêtê: and that System, with the
enlargements which turned it into the Perfect System,
kept its ground with all writers of the Aristoxenean
school.</p>

<p>Even in the accounts of the pseudo-Euclid and the
later writers, who treat of the Species of the Octave
under the names of the Keys, there is much to show
that the species existed chiefly or wholly in musical
theory. The seven species of the Octave are given
along with the three species of the Fourth and the
four species of the Fifth, neither of which appear to
have had any practical application. Another indication
of this may be seen in the seventh or Hypo-dorian
species, which was also called Locrian and Common
(ps. Eucl. p. 16 Meib.). Why should this species have
more than one name? In the Perfect System it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
singular in being exemplified by two different octaves,
viz. that from Proslambanomenos to Mesê, and that
from Mesê to Nêtê Hyperbolaiôn. Now we have seen
that the higher the octave which represents a species,
the lower the key of the same name. In this case,
then, the upper of the two octaves answers to the
Hypo-dorian key, and the lower to the Locrian. But if
the species has its two names from these two keys,
it follows that the names of the species are derived
from the keys. The fact that the Hypo-dorian or
Locrian species was also called Common is a further
argument to the same purpose. It was doubtless
'common' in the sense that it characterised the two
octaves which made up the Perfect System. Thus the
Perfect System was recognised as the really important
scale.</p>

<p>Another consideration, which has been overlooked
by Westphal and those who follow him, is the difference
between the species of the Octave in the several
genera, especially the difference between the Diatonic
and the Enharmonic. This is not felt as a difficulty
with all the species. Thus the so-called Dorian octave
<i>e-e</i> is in the Enharmonic genus <i>e e* f a b b* c e</i>, a scale
which may be regarded as the Diatonic with <i>g</i> and <i>d</i>
omitted, and the semitones divided. But the Phrygian
<i>d-d</i> cannot pass in any such way into the Enharmonic
Phrygian <i>c e e* f a b b* c</i>, which answers rather to the
Diatonic scale of the species <i>c-c</i> (the Lydian). The
scholars who connect the ancient Modes with the
species generally confine themselves to octaves of the
Diatonic genus. In this they are supported by later
Greek writers&mdash;notably, as we shall see, by Ptolemy&mdash;and
by the analogy of the mediaeval Modes or Tones.
But on the other side we have the repeated complaints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of Aristoxenus that the earlier theorists confined themselves
to Enharmonic octave scales. We have also the
circumstance that the writer or compiler of the pseudo-Euclidean
treatise, who is our earliest authority for
the names of the species, gives these names for the
Enharmonic genus only. Here, once more, we feel
the difference between theory and practice. To
a theorist there is no great difficulty in the terms
Diatonic Phrygian and Enharmonic Phrygian meaning
essentially different things. But the 'Phrygian Mode'
in practical music must have been a tolerably definite
musical form.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 25. <i>The Ethos of Music.</i></h2>

<p>From Plato and Aristotle we have learned some
elements of what may be called the gamut of sensibility.
Between the higher keys which in Greece, as in
Oriental countries generally, were the familiar vehicle of
passion, especially of the passion of grief, and the lower
keys which were regarded, by Plato at least, as the
natural language of ease and license, there were keys
expressive of calm and balanced states of mind, free
from the violent extremes of pain and pleasure. In
some later writers on music we find this classification
reduced to a more regular form, and clothed in technical
language. We find also, what is still more to our
purpose, an attempt to define more precisely the musical
forms which answered to the several states of temper or
emotion.</p>

<p>Among the writers in question the most instructive
is Aristides Quintilianus. He discusses the subject of
musical ethos under the first of the usual seven heads,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
that which deals with sounds or notes (<b>peri phthongôn</b>).
Among the distinctions to be drawn in regard to notes
he reckons that of ethos: the ethos of notes, he says,
is different as they are higher or lower, and also as
they are in the place of a Parhypatê or in the place
of a Lichanos (p. 13 Meib. <b>hetera gar êthê tois oxyterois,
hetera tois baryterois epitrechei, kai hetera men parypatoeidesin,
hetera de lichanoeidesin</b>). Again, under the seventh
head, that of <b>melopoiia</b> or composition, he treats of the
'regions of the voice' (<b>topoi tês phônês</b>). There are three
kinds of composition, he tells us (<a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>), viz. that which
is akin to Hypatê (<b>hypatoeidês</b>), that which is akin to Mesê
(<b>mesoeidês</b>), and that which is akin to Nêtê (<b>nêtoeidês</b>).
The first part of the art of composition is the choice
(<b>lêpsis</b>) which the musician is able to make of the
region of the voice to be employed (<b>lêpsis men di' hês
heuriskein tô mousikô perigignetai apo poiou tês phônês to
systêma topou poiêteon, poteron hypatoeidous ê tôn loipôn
tinos</b>). He then proceeds to connect these regions,
or different parts of the musical scale, with different
branches of lyrical poetry. 'There are three styles of
musical composition (<b>tropoi tês melopoiias</b>), viz. the
Nomic, the Dithyrambic, and the Tragic; and of these
the Nomic is netoid, the Dithyrambic is mesoid, and
the Tragic is hypatoid.... They are called styles
(<b>tropoi</b>) because according to the melody adopted they
express the ethos of the mind. Thus it happens that
composition (<b>melopoiia</b>) may differ in <i>genus</i>, as Enharmonic,
Chromatic: in <i>System</i>, as Hypatoid, Mesoid,
Netoid: in <i>key</i>, as Dorian, Phrygian: in <i>style</i>, as Nomic,
Dithyrambic: in <i>ethos</i>, as we call one kind of composition
"contracting" (<b>systaltikê</b>), viz. that by which we move
painful feelings; another "expanding" (<b>diastaltikê</b>), that
by which we arouse the spirit (<b>thymos</b>); and another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
"middle" (<b>mesê</b>), that by which we bring round the soul
to calmness.'</p>

<p>This passage does not quite explicitly connect the
three kinds of ethos&mdash;the diastaltic, the systaltic, the
intermediate&mdash;with the three regions of the voice;
but the connexion was evidently implied, and is laid
down in express terms in the pseudo-Euclidean <i>Introductio</i>
(p. 21 Meib.). According to this Aristoxenean
writer, 'the diastaltic ethos of musical composition is
that which expresses grandeur and manly elevation of
soul (<b>megaloprepeia kai diarma psychês andrôdes</b>), and
heroic actions; and these are employed by tragedy and
all poetry that approaches the tragic type. The systaltic
ethos is that by which the soul is brought down into
a humble and unmanly frame; and such a disposition will
be fitting for amatory effusions and dirges and lamentations
and the like. And the hesychastic or tranquilly disposed
ethos (<b>hêsychastikon êthos</b>) of musical composition is
that which is followed by calmness of soul and a liberal
and peaceful disposition: and this temper will fit hymns,
paeans, laudations, didactic poetry and the like.' It
appears then that difference in the 'place' (<b>topos</b>) of the
notes employed in a composition&mdash;difference, that is to
say, of pitch&mdash;was the element which chiefly determined
its ethos, and (by consequence) which distinguished
the music appropriate to the several kinds of lyrical
poetry.</p>

<p>A slightly different version of this piece of theory is
preserved in the anonymous treatise edited by Bellermann
(§§ 63, 64), where the 'regions of the voice' are
said to be four in number, viz. the three already mentioned,
and a fourth which takes its name from the
tetrachord Hyperbolaiôn (<b>topos hyperboloeidês</b>). In the
same passage the boundaries of the several regions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
are laid down by reference to the keys. 'The lowest
or hypatoid region reaches from the Hypo-dorian
Hypatê Mesôn to the Dorian Mesê; the intermediate
or mesoid region from the Phrygian Hypatê Mesôn
to the Lydian Mesê; the netoid region from the
Lydian Mesê to the Nêtê Synemmenôn; the hyperboloid
region embracing all above the last point.'
The text of this passage is uncertain; but the general
character of the <b>topoi</b> or regions of the voice is clearly
enough indicated.</p>

<p>The three regions are mentioned in the catechism of
Bacchius (p. 11 Meib.): <b>topous</b> (MSS. <b>tropous</b>) <b>de tês
phônês posous legomen einai? treis. tinas? toutous; oxyn,
meson, baryn.</b> The varieties of ethos also appear (p. 14
Meib.): <b>hê de metabolê kata êthos? hotan ek tapeinou eis
megaloprepes; ê ex hêsychou kai synnou eis parakekinêkos.</b>
'What is change of ethos? when a change is made from
the humble to the magnificent; or from the tranquil
and sober to violent emotion.'</p>

<p>When we compare the doctrine of musical ethos as
we find it in these later writers with the indications
to be gathered from Plato and Aristotle, the chief
difference appears to be that we no longer hear of
the ethos of particular modes, but only of that of three or
(at the most) four portions of the scale. The principle
of the division, it is evident, is simply difference of
pitch. But if that was the basis of the ethical effect
of music in later times, the circumstance goes far to
confirm us in the conclusion that it was the pitch of
the music, rather than any difference in the succession
of the intervals, that principally determined the ethical
character of the older modes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 26. <i>The Ethos of the Genera and Species.</i></h2>

<p>Although the pitch of a musical composition&mdash;as
these passages confirm us in believing&mdash;was the chief
ground of its ethical character, it cannot be said that no
other element entered into the case.</p>

<p>In the passage quoted above from Aristides Quintilianus
(p. 13 Meib.) it is said that ethos depends first
on pitch (<b>hetera êthê tois oxyterois, hetera tois baryterois</b>),
and secondly on the moveable notes, that is to say, on
the <i>genus</i>. For that is evidently involved in the words
that follow: <b>kai hetera men parypatoeidesin, hetera de
lichanoeidesin.</b> By <b>parypatoeideis</b> and <b>lichanoeideis</b> he
means all the moveable notes (<b>phthongoi pheromenoi</b>): the
first are those which hold the place of Parhypatê in
their tetrachord, viz. the notes called Parhypatê or
Tritê: the second are similarly the notes called Lichanos
or Paranêtê. These moveable notes, then, give an ethos
to the music because they determine the genus of the
scale. Regarding the particular ethos belonging to the
different genera, there is a statement of the same author
(<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>) to the effect that the Diatonic is masculine and
austere (<b>arrhenôpon d' esti kai austêroteron</b>), the Chromatic
sweet and plaintive (<b>hêdiston te kai goeron</b>), the
Enharmonic stirring and pleasing (<b>diegertikon d' esti
touto kai êpion</b>). The criticism doubtless came from
some earlier source.</p>

<p>Do we ever find ethos attributed to this or that <i>species</i>
of the Octave? I can find no passage in which this
source of ethos is indicated. Even Ptolemy, who is the
chief authority (as we shall see) for the value of the
species, and who makes least of mere difference of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
pitch, recognises only two forms of modulation in the
course of a melody, viz. change of genus and change of
pitch<a name="FNanchor_1_25" id="FNanchor_1_25"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 27. <i>The Musical Notation.</i></h2>

<p>As the preceding argument turns very much upon
the practical importance of the scale which we have
been discussing, first as the single octave from the
original Hypatê to Nêtê, then in its enlarged form as
the Perfect System, it may be worth while to show
that some such scale is implied in the history of the
Greek musical notation.</p>

<p>The use of written characters (<b>sêmeia</b>) to represent
the sounds of music appears to date from a comparatively
early period in Greece. In the time of
Aristoxenus the art of writing down a melody (<b>parasêmantikê</b>)
had come to be considered by some persons
identical with the science of music (<b>harmonikê</b>),&mdash;an error
which Aristoxenus is at some pains to refute. It is
true that the authorities from whom we derive our
knowledge of the Greek notation are post-classical.
But the characters themselves, as we shall presently
see, furnish sufficient evidence of their antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The Greek musical notation is curiously complicated.
There is a double set of characters, one for the note
assigned to the singer, the other for those of the lyre
or other instrument. The notes for the voice are
obviously derived from the letters of the ordinary Ionic
alphabet, multiplied by the use of accents and other
diacritical marks. The instrumental notes were first
explained less than thirty years ago by Westphal. In
his work <i>Harmonik und Melopöie der Griechen</i> (c. viii
<i>Die Semantik</i>) he showed, in a manner as conclusive as
it is ingenious, that they were originally taken from the
first fourteen letters of an alphabet of archaic type, akin
to the alphabets found in certain parts of Peloponnesus.
Among the letters which he traces, and which point to
this conclusion, the most-significant are the digamma,
the primitive crooked iota
<img title="iota" alt="iota" src="images/crooked_iota.gif" width="24" height="20" />,
and two forms of lambda,
<img title="lambda1" alt="lambda1" src="images/lambda1.gif" width="29" height="18" /> and
<img title="lambda2" alt="lambda2" src="images/lambda2.gif" width="16" height="17" />,
the latter of which is peculiar to the alphabet
of Argos. Of the other characters
<img title="alpha1" alt="alpha1" src="images/alpha1.gif" width="17" height="18" />,
which stands for
alpha, is best derived from the archaic form
<img title="archaic_alpha" alt="archaic_alpha" src="images/archaic_alpha.gif" width="24" height="21" />. For
beta we find <img title="archaic_beta" alt="archaic_beta" src="images/archaic_beta.gif" width="20" height="17" />,
which may come from an archaic form
of the letter<a name="FNanchor_1_26" id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.
The character <img title="delta1" alt="delta1" src="images/delta1.gif" width="19" height="18" />,
as Westphal shows, is for
<img title="delta2" alt="delta2" src="images/delta2.gif" width="19" height="19" />,
or delta with part of one side left out. Similarly
the ancient <img title="circle_dot" alt="circle_dot" src="images/circle_dot.gif" width="19" height="19" />,
when the circle was incomplete, yielded
the character <span style="font-size: 150%"><b> C </b></span>.
The crooked iota (<img title="iota" alt="iota" src="images/crooked_iota.gif" width="24" height="20" />)
appears as <img title="iota2" alt="iota2" src="images/crooked_iota02.gif" width="24" height="22" />.
The two forms of lambda serve for different notes, thus
bringing the number of symbols up to fifteen. Besides
these there are two characters,
<img title="reclining_p" alt="reclining_p" src="images/reclining_p.gif" width="23" height="18" />and
<img title="epsilon01" alt="epsilon01" src="images/epsilon01.gif" width="18" height="17" />, which cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
be derived in the same way from any alphabet. As
they stand for the lowest notes of the scale, they are
probably an addition, later than the rest of the system.
At the upper end, again, the scale is extended by the
simple device of using the same characters for notes an
octave higher, distinguishing them in this use by an
accent. The original fifteen characters, with the letters
from which they are derived, and the corresponding
notes in the modern musical scale, are as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/p_069.jpg" width="900" height="176" alt="15-characters" /></p>

<p>These notes, it will be seen, compose two octaves of
the Diatonic scale, identical with the two octaves of
the Greater Perfect System. They may be regarded
as answering to the white notes of the modern keyboard,&mdash;those
which form the complete scale in the
so-called 'natural' key.</p>

<p>The other notes, viz. those which are required not
only in different keys of the Diatonic scale, but also in
all Enharmonic and Chromatic scales, are represented
by the same characters modified in some simple way.
Usually a character is turned half round backwards to
raise it by one small interval (as from Hypatê to Parhypatê),
and reversed to raise it by both (Hypatê to
Lichanos). Thus the letter epsilon,
<img title="epsilon02" alt="epsilon02" src="images/epsilon02.gif" width="25" height="21" />,
stands for our <i>c</i>: and accordingly
<img title="epsilon04" alt="epsilon04" src="images/epsilon04.gif" width="19" height="13" />
(<img title="epsilon02" alt="epsilon02" src="images/epsilon02.gif" width="25" height="21" /> <b>anestrammenon</b> or <b>hyption</b>)
stands for <i>c*</i>, and
<img title="epsilon03" alt="epsilon03" src="images/epsilon03.gif" width="25" height="21" />
(<img title="epsilon02" alt="epsilon02" src="images/epsilon02.gif" width="25" height="21" />
<b>apestrammenon</b>) for <i>c&#9839;&nbsp;</i>. The
Enharmonic scale <i>c-c*-c&#9839;-f</i> is therefore written
<img title="enharmonicscale" alt="enharmonicscale" src="images/enharmonicscale.gif" width="107" height="27" />,
the two modifications of the letter
<img title="epsilon02" alt="epsilon02" src="images/epsilon02.gif" width="25" height="21" />
representing the two 'moveable' notes of the tetrachord.
Similarly we have the triads
<img alt="triad01" src="images/triad01.gif" width="76" height="28" />,
<img alt="triad02" src="images/triad02.gif" width="51" height="21" />,
<img alt="triad03" src="images/triad03.gif" width="69" height="22" />,
<img alt="triad04" src="images/triad04.gif" width="161" height="26" />,
<img alt="triad05" src="images/triad05.gif" width="77" height="28" />,
<img alt="triad06" src="images/triad06.gif" width="72" height="18" />,
<img alt="triad07" src="images/triad07.gif" width="67" height="27" />.
As some letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
do not admit of this kind of differentiation, other
methods are employed. Thus <b>&Delta;</b> is made to yield the
forms
<img alt="delta1" src="images/delta1.gif" width="19" height="18" />
(for <img alt="delta2" src="images/delta2.gif" width="19" height="19" />)
<img alt="delta3" src="images/delta3.gif" width="19" height="19" /> <b>&Delta;</b>:
from <b>H</b> (or <b>B</b>) are obtained the
forms <img alt="capalpha1" src="images/capalpha1.gif" width="21" height="18" />
and <img alt="capalpha2" src="images/capalpha2.gif" width="21" height="18" />:
and from <b>Z</b> (or <b>I]</b>) the forms
<img alt="lambda3" src="images/lambda3.gif" width="23" height="24" />
and <img alt="lambda4" src="images/lambda4.gif" width="23" height="24" />.
The modifications of <b>N</b> are <span style="font-size: 150%"><b>/</b></span> and <span style="font-size: 150%"><b>\</b></span>:
those of <img alt="alpha1" src="images/alpha1.gif" width="17" height="18" /> are
<img alt="alpha2" src="images/alpha2.gif" width="26" height="21" /> and
<img alt="alpha3" src="images/alpha3.gif" width="26" height="21" />.</p>

<p>The method of writing a Chromatic tetrachord is the
same, except that the higher of the two moveable notes
is marked by a bar or accent. Thus the tetrachord
<i>c c&#9839; d f</i> is written
<img alt="enharmonicscale" src="images/enharmonicscale.gif" width="107" height="27" />.</p>

<p>In the Diatonic genus we should have expected that
the original characters would have been used for the
tetrachords <i>b c d e</i> and <i>e f g a</i>; and that in other tetrachords
the second note, being a semitone above the
first, would have been represented by a reversed letter
(<b>gramma apestrammenon</b>). In fact, however, the Diatonic
Parhypatê and Tritê are written with the same character
as the Enharmonic. That is to say, the tetrachord
<i>b c d e</i> is not written
<img alt="tetrachord01" src="images/tetrachord01.gif" width="87" height="27" />, but
<img alt="tetrachord02" src="images/tetrachord02.gif" width="90" height="29" />:
and <i>d &nbsp;e&#9837; f g</i>
is not <img alt="tetrachord03" src="images/tetrachord03.gif" width="85" height="27" />,
but <img alt="tetrachord04" src="images/tetrachord04.gif" width="87" height="32" />.</p>

<p>Let us now consider how this scheme of symbols is
related to the Systems already described and the Keys
in which those Systems may be set (<b>tonoi eph' hôn tithemena
ta systêmata melôdeitai</b>).</p>

<p>The fifteen characters, it has been noticed, form two
diatonic octaves. It will appear on a little further
examination that the scheme must have been constructed
with a view to these two octaves. The
successive notes are not expressed by the letters of the
alphabet in their usual order (as is done in the case of
the vocal notes). The highest note is represented by
the first letter, <b>A</b>: and then the remaining fourteen
notes are taken in pairs, each with its octave: and each
of the pairs of notes is represented by two successive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
letters&mdash;the two forms of lambda counting as one such
pair of letters. Thus:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/p_071.gif" width="546" height="227" alt="The Greek notes" /></p>

<p>On this plan the alphabetical order of the letters serves
as a series of links connecting the highest and lowest
notes of every one of the seven octaves that can be
taken on the scale. It is evident that the scheme
cannot have grown up by degrees, but is the work of
an inventor who contrived it for the practical requirements
of the music of his time.</p>

<p>Two questions now arise, which it is impossible to
separate. What is the scale or System for which the
notation was originally devised? And how and when
was the notation adapted to exhibit the several keys in
which any such System might be set?</p>

<p>The enquiry must start from the remarkable fact that
the two octaves represented by the fifteen original
letters are in the <i>Hypo-lydian</i> key&mdash;the key which
down to the time of Aristoxenus was called the Hypo-dorian.
Are we to suppose that the scheme was devised
in the first instance for that key only? This assumption
forms the basis of the ingenious and elaborate theory
by which M. Gevaert explains the development of the
notation (<i>Musique de l'Antiquité</i>, t. I. pp. 244 ff.). It is
open to the obvious objection that the Hypo-lydian
(or Hypo-dorian) cannot have been the oldest key.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
M. Gevaert meets this difficulty by supposing that the
original scale was in the Dorian key, and that subsequently,
from some cause the nature of which we cannot
guess, a change of pitch took place by which the Dorian
scale became a semitone higher. It is perhaps simpler
to conjecture that the original Dorian became split up,
so to speak, into two keys by difference of local usage,
and that the lower of the two came to be called
Hypo-dorian, but kept the original notation. A more
serious difficulty is raised by the high antiquity which
M. Gevaert assigns to the Perfect System. He supposes
that the inventor of the notation made use of an
instrument (the <i>magadis</i>) which 'magadised' or repeated
the notes an octave higher. But this would give us
a repetition of the primitive octave <i>e-e</i>, rather than an
enlargement by the addition of tetrachords at both ends.</p>

<p>M. Gevaert regards the adaptation of the scheme to
the other keys as the result of a gradual process of
extension. Here we may distinguish between the
recourse to the modified characters&mdash;which served
essentially the same purpose as the 'sharps' and 'flats'
in the signature of a modern key&mdash;and the additional
notes obtained either by means of new characters
(<img alt="reclining_p" src="images/reclining_p.gif" width="23" height="18" />
and <img alt="epsilon01" src="images/epsilon01.gif" width="18" height="17" />),
or by the use of accents
(<img alt="GammaPrime" src="images/gammaprime.gif" width="17" height="19" />, &amp;c.). The Hypo-dorian
and Hypo-phrygian, which employ the new
characters <img alt="reclining_p" src="images/reclining_p.gif" width="23" height="18" />
and <img alt="epsilon01" src="images/epsilon01.gif" width="18" height="17" />,
are known to be comparatively recent.
The Phrygian and Lydian, it is true, employ
the accented notes; but they do so only in the highest
tetrachord (Hyperbolaiôn), which may not have been
originally used in these high keys. The modified
characters doubtless belong to an earlier period. They
are needed for the three oldest keys&mdash;Dorian, Phrygian,
Lydian&mdash;and also for the Enharmonic and Chromatic
genera. If they are not part of the original scheme,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the musician who devised them may fairly be counted
as the second inventor of the instrumental notation.</p>

<p>In setting out the scales of the several keys it will
be unnecessary to give more than the standing notes
(<b>phthongoi hestôtes</b>), which are nearly all represented by
original or unmodified letters&mdash;the moveable notes being
represented by the modified forms described above.
The following list includes the standing notes, viz.
Proslambanomenos, Hypatê Hypatôn, Hypatê Mesôn,
Mesê, Paramesê, Nêtê Diezeugmenôn and Nêtê Hyperbolaiôn
in the seven oldest keys: the two lowest are
marked as doubtful:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/p_073.jpg" width="900" height="457" alt="Greek symbols" /></p>

<p>It will be evident that this scheme of notation tallies
fairly well with what we know of the compass of Greek
instruments about the end of the fifth century, and also
with the account which Aristoxenus gives of the keys
in use up to his time. We need only refer to what has
been said above on <a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a> and <a href="#Page_37">p. 37.</a></p>

<p>It would be beyond the scope of this essay to discuss
the date of the Greek musical notation. A few remarks,
however, may be made, especially with reference to the
high antiquity assigned to it by Westphal.</p>

<p>The alphabet from which it was derived was certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
an archaic one. It contained several characters, in
particular <img alt="digamma" src="images/digamma01.gif" width="19" height="24" /> for digamma,
<img alt="iota" src="images/crooked_iota.gif" width="24" height="20" /> for iota,
and <img alt="lambda4" src="images/lambda4.gif" width="23" height="24" /> for lambda,
which belong to the period before the introduction of
the Ionian alphabet. Indeed if we were to judge from
these letters alone we should be led to assign the
instrumental notation (as Westphal does) to the time of
Solon. The three-stroke iota (<img alt="iota" src="images/crooked_iota.gif" width="24" height="20" />),
in particular, does
not occur in any alphabet later than the sixth century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> On the other hand, when we find that the notation
implies the use of a musical System in advance of any
scale recognised in Aristotle, or even in Aristoxenus,
such a date becomes incredible. We can only suppose
either (1) that the use of
<img alt="iota" src="images/crooked_iota.gif" width="24" height="20" /> in the fifth century was
confined to localities of which we have no complete
epigraphic record, or (2) that
<img alt="iota" src="images/crooked_iota.gif" width="24" height="20" /> as a form of iota was
still known&mdash;as archaic forms must have been&mdash;from
the older public inscriptions, and was adopted by the
inventor of the notation as being better suited to his
purpose than <img alt="iota" src="images/iota03.gif" width="12" height="18" />.</p>

<p>With regard to the place of origin of the notation
the chief fact which we have to deal with is the use
of the character <img alt="lambda" src="images/lambda2.gif" width="16" height="17" />
for lambda, which is distinctive of the
alphabet of Argos, along with the commoner form
<img alt="lambda" src="images/lambda1.gif" width="29" height="18" />.
Westphal indeed asserts that both these forms are
found in the Argive alphabet. But the inscription
(<b>C. I. 1</b>) which he quotes<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
for <img alt="lambda" src="images/lambda1.gif" width="29" height="18" /> really
contains only <img alt="lambda" src="images/lambda2.gif" width="16" height="17" />
in a slightly different form. We cannot therefore say
that the inventor of the notation derived it entirely
from the alphabet of Argos, but only that he shows an
acquaintance with that alphabet. This is confirmed by
the fact that the form <img alt="iota" src="images/crooked_iota.gif" width="24" height="20" />
for iota is not found at Argos.
Probably therefore the inventor drew upon more than
one alphabet for his purpose, the Argive alphabet being one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The special fitness of the notation for the scales of
the Enharmonic genus may be regarded as a further
indication of its date. We shall see presently that that
genus held a peculiar predominance in the earliest
period of musical theory&mdash;that, namely, which was
brought to an end by Aristoxenus.</p>

<p>If the author of the notation&mdash;or the second author,
inventor of the modified characters&mdash;was one of the
musicians whose names have come down to us, it would
be difficult to find a more probable one than that of
Pronomus of Thebes. One of the most striking features
of the notation, at the time when it was framed, must
have been the adjustment of the keys. Even in the time
of Aristoxenus, as we know from the passage so often
quoted, that adjustment was not universal. But it is
precisely what Pronomus of Thebes is said to have
done for the music of the flute (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>). The
circumstance that the system was only used for instrumental
music is at least in harmony with this conjecture.
If it is thought that Thebes is too far from Argos, we
may fall back upon the notice that Sacadas of Argos
was the chief composer for the flute before the time of Pronomus,
<a name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
and doubtless Argos was one of the first
cities to share in the advance which Pronomus made in
the technique of his art.</p>

<h2>§ 28. <i>Traces of the Species in the Notation.</i></h2>

<p>Before leaving this part of the subject it will be well
to notice the attempt which Westphal makes to connect
the species of the Octave with the form of the musical notation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The basis of the notation, as has been explained
(<a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a>), is formed by two Diatonic octaves, denoted by
the letters of the alphabet from <b>&alpha;</b> to <b>&nu;</b>, as follows:</p>

<p>In this scale, as has been pointed out (<a href="#Page_71">p. 71</a>), the
notes which are at the distance of an octave from each
other are always expressed by two <i>successive</i> letters
of the alphabet. Thus we find&mdash;</p>

<p>Westphal adopts the theory of Boeckh (as to which
<a href="#Page_11">see p. 11</a>) that the Hypo-phrygian and Hypo-dorian
species answered to the ancient Ionian and Aeolian
modes. On this assumption he argues that the order
of the pairs of letters representing the species agrees
with the order of the Modes in the historical development
of Greek music. For the priority of Dorian,
Ionian, and Aeolian he appeals to the authority of
Heraclides Ponticus, quoted above (<a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a>). The Lydian,
he supposes, was interposed in the second place on
account of its importance in education,&mdash;recognised, as
we have seen, by Aristotle in the <i>Politics</i> (viii. 7 <i>ad fin.</i>).
Hence he regards the notation as confirming his theory
of the nature and history of the Modes.</p>

<p>The weakness of this reasoning is manifold. Granting
that the Hypo-dorian and Hypo-phrygian answer to the
old Aeolian and Ionian respectively, we have to ask
what is the nature of the priority which Heraclides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Ponticus claims for his three modes, and what is the
value of his testimony. What he says is, in substance,
that these are the only kinds of music that are truly
Hellenic, and worthy of the name of modes (<b>harmoniai</b>).
It can hardly be thought that this is a criticism likely
to have weighed with the inventor of the notation.
But if it did, why did he give an equally prominent
place to Lydian, one of the modes which Heraclides
condemned? In fact, the introduction of Lydian goes
far to show that the coincidence&mdash;such as it is&mdash;with
the views of Heraclides is mere accident. Apart,
however, from these difficulties, there are at least two
considerations which seem fatal to Westphal's theory:</p>

<p>1. The notation, so far as the original two octaves are
concerned, must have been devised and worked out at
some one time. No part of these two octaves can have
been completed before the rest. Hence the order in
which the letters are taken for the several notes has no
historical importance.</p>

<p>2. The notation does not represent only the <i>species</i>
of a scale, that is to say, the relative pitch of the notes
which compose it, but it represents also the absolute
pitch of each note. Thus the octaves which are defined
by the successive pairs of letters, <b>&beta;-&gamma;, &delta;-&epsilon;</b>, and the
rest, are octaves of definite notes. If they were framed
with a view to the ancient modes, as Westphal thinks,
they must be the actual scales employed in these modes.
If so, the modes followed each other, in respect of pitch,
in an order exactly the reverse of the order observed
in the keys. It need hardly be said that this is quite impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 29. <i>Ptolemy's Scheme of Modes.</i></h2>

<p>The first writer who takes the Species of the Octave
as the basis of the musical scales is the mathematician
Claudius Ptolemaeus (fl. 140-160 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>). In his <i>Harmonics</i>
he virtually sets aside the scheme of keys
elaborated by Aristoxenus and his school, and adopts
in their place a system of scales answering in their
main features to the mediaeval Tones or Modes. The
object of difference of key, he says, is not that the
music as a whole may be of a higher or lower pitch,
but that a melody may be brought within a certain
compass. For this purpose it is necessary to vary the
succession of intervals (as a modern musician does
by changing the signature of the clef). If, for example,
we take the Perfect System (<b>systêma ametabolon</b>) in the
key of <i>a</i> minor&mdash;which is its natural key,&mdash;and transpose
it to the key of <i>d</i> minor, we do so, according to
Ptolemy, not in order to raise the general pitch of our
music by a Fourth, but because we wish to have a scale
with <i>b</i> flat instead of <i>b</i> natural. The flattening of this
note, however, means that the two octaves change their
species. They are now of the species <i>e-e</i>. Thus,
instead of transposing the Perfect System into different
keys, we arrive more directly at the desired result by
changing the species of its octaves. And as there are
seven possible species of the Octave, we obtain seven
different Systems or scales. From these assumptions
it follows, as Ptolemy shows in some detail, that any
greater number of keys is useless. If a key is an
octave higher than another, it is superfluous because
it gives us a mere repetition of the same intervals
<a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>If we interpose a key between (<i>e.g.</i>) the Hypo-dorian
and the Hypo-phrygian, it must give us over again
either the Hypo-dorian or the Hypo-phrygian scale
<a name="FNanchor_1_30" id="FNanchor_1_30"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.
Thus the fifteen keys of the Aristoxeneans are reduced
to seven, and these seven are not transpositions of
a single scale, but are all of the same pitch. See the
table at the end of the book.</p>

<p>With this scheme of Keys Ptolemy combined a new
method of naming the individual notes. The old
method, by which a note was named from its relative
place in the Perfect System, must evidently have
become inconvenient. The Lydian Mesê, for example,
was two tones higher than the Dorian Mesê, because
the Lydian scale as a whole was two tones higher than
the Dorian. But when the two scales were reduced to
the same compass, the old Lydian Mesê was no longer
in the middle of the scale, and the name ceased to have
a meaning. It is as though the term 'dominant' when
applied to a Minor key were made to mean the dominant
of the relative Major key. On Ptolemy's method
the notes of each scale were named from their places in
it. The old names were used, Proslambanomenos for
the lowest, Hypatê Hypatôn for the next, and so on,
but without regard to the intervals between the notes.
Thus there were two methods of naming, that which
had been in use hitherto, termed 'nomenclature according
to <i>value</i>' (<b>onomasia kata dynamin</b>), and the new
method of naming from the various scales, termed
'nomenclature according to <i>position</i>' (<b>onomasia kata
thesin</b>). The former was in effect a retention of the
Perfect System and the Keys: the latter put in their
place a scheme of seven different standard Systems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>In illustration of his theory Ptolemy gives tables
showing in numbers the intervals of the octaves used
in the different keys and genera. He shows two
octaves in each key, viz. that from Hypatê Mesôn (<b>kata
thesin</b>) to Nêtê Diezeugmenôn (called the octave <b>apo
nêtês</b>), and that from Proslambanomenos to Mesê (the
octave <b>apo mesês</b>). As he also gives the divisions of
five different 'colours' or varieties of genus, the whole
number of octaves is no less than seventy.</p>

<p>Ptolemy does not exclude difference of pitch altogether.
The whole instrument, he says, may be tuned
higher or lower at pleasure<a name="FNanchor_1_31" id="FNanchor_1_31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.
Thus the pitch is treated
by him as modern notation treats the <i>tempo</i>, viz. as
something which is not absolutely given, but has to be
supplied by the individual performer.</p>

<p>Although the language of Ptolemy's exposition is
studiously impersonal, it may be gathered that his
reduction of the number of keys from fifteen to seven
was an innovation proposed by himself<a name="FNanchor_2_32" id="FNanchor_2_32"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.
If this is so, the rest of the scheme,&mdash;the elimination of the element of
pitch, and the 'nomenclature by position,'&mdash;must also be
due to him. Here, however, we find ourselves at issue
with Westphal and those who agree with him on the
main question of the Modes. According to Westphal the
nomenclature by position is mentioned by Aristoxenus,
and is implied in at least one important passage of the
Aristotelian <i>Problems</i>. We have now to examine the
evidence which he adduces to support his contention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 30. <i>Nomenclature by Position.</i></h2>

<p>Two passages of Aristoxenus are quoted by Westphal
in support of his contention. The first (p. 6 Meib.) is one
in which Aristoxenus announces his intention to treat
of Systems, their number and nature: 'setting out their
differences in respect of compass (<b>megethos</b>), and for each
compass the differences in form and composition and
position (<b>tas te kata schêma kai kata synthesin kai kata
thesin</b>), so that no element of melody,&mdash;either compass or
form or composition or position,&mdash;may be unexplained.'
But the word <b>thesis</b>, when applied to Systems, does not
mean the 'position' of single notes, but of groups of
notes. Elsewhere (p. 54 Meib.) he speaks of the position
of tetrachords towards each other (<b>tas tôn tetrachordôn
pros allêla theseis</b>), laying it down that any two tetrachords
in the same System must be consonant either
with each other or with some third tetrachord. The
other passage quoted by Westphal (p. 69 Meib.) is also
in the discussion of Systems. Aristoxenus is pointing
out the necessity of recognising that some elements of
melodious succession are fixed and limited, others are
unlimited:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>kata men oun ta megethê tôn diastêmatôn kai tas tôn phthongôn
taseis apeira pôs phainetai einai ta peri melos, kata de tas
dynameis kai kata ta eidê kai kata tas theseis peperasmena te
kai tetagmena.</b></p>

<p>'In the size of the intervals and the pitch of the notes
the elements of melody seem to be infinite; but in respect
of the values (<i>i.e.</i> the relative places of the notes) and in
respect of the forms (<i>i.e.</i> the succession of the intervals) and
in respect of the positions they are limited and settled.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aristoxenus goes on to illustrate this by supposing that
we wish to continue a scale downwards from a <b>pyknon</b> or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
pair of small intervals (Chromatic or Enharmonic). In
this case, as the <b>pyknon</b> forms the lower part of a tetrachord,
there are two possibilities. If the next lower
tetrachord is disjunct, the next interval is a tone; if it
is conjunct, the next interval is the large interval of the
genus (<b>hê men gar kata tonon eis diazeuxin agei to tou systêmatos
eidos, hê de kata thateron diastêma ho ti dêpot' echei
megethos eis synaphên</b>). Thus the succession of intervals
is determined by the relative position of the two tetrachords,
as to which there is a choice between two definite
alternatives. This then is evidently what is meant
by the words <b>kata tas theseis</b><a name="FNanchor_1_33" id="FNanchor_1_33"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. On the other hand the
<b>thesis</b> of Ptolemy's nomenclature is the absolute pitch
(<i>Harm.</i> ii. 5 <b>pote men par' autên tên thesin, to oxyteron
haplôs ê baryteron, onomazomen</b>), and this is one of the
elements which according to Aristoxenus are indefinite.</p>

<p>Westphal also finds the nomenclature by position
implied in the passage of the Aristotelian <i>Problems</i>
(xix. 20) which deals with the peculiar relation of the
Mesê to the rest of the musical scale. The passage has
already been quoted and discussed (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>), and
it has been pointed out that if the Mesê of the Perfect
System (<b>mesê kata dynamin</b>) is the key-note, the scale
must have been an octave of the <i>a</i>-species. If octaves
of other species were used, as Westphal maintains, it
becomes necessary to take the Mesê of this passage to
be the <b>mesê kata thesin</b>, or Mesê by position. That is,
Westphal is obliged by his theory of the Modes to take
the term Mesê in a sense of which there is no other
trace before the time of Ptolemy. But&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) It is highly improbable that the names of the
notes&mdash;Mesê, Hypatê, Nêtê and the rest&mdash;should have
had two distinct meanings. Such an ambiguity would
have been intolerable, and only to be compared with
the similar ambiguity which Westphal's theory implies
in the use of the terms Dorian, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) If the different species of the octave were the
practically important scales, as Westphal maintains, the
position of the notes in these scales must have been
correspondingly important. Hence the nomenclature
by position must have been the more usual and familiar
one. Yet, as we have shown, it is not found in
Aristotle, Aristoxenus or Euclid&mdash;to say nothing of
later writers.</p>

<p>(3) The nomenclature by position is an essential part
of the scheme of Keys proposed by Ptolemy. It bears
the same relation to Ptolemy's octaves as the nomenclature
by 'value' bears to the old standard octave and
the Perfect System. It was probably therefore devised
about the time of Ptolemy, if not actually by him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 31. <i>Scales of the Lyre and Cithara.</i></h2>

<p>The earliest evidence in practical music of any
octaves other than those of the standard System is to
be found in the account given by Ptolemy of certain
scales employed on the lyre and cithara. According to
this account the scales of the lyre (the simpler and
commoner instrument) were of two kinds. One was
Diatonic, of the 'colour' or variety which Ptolemy
recognises as the prevailing one, viz. the 'Middle Soft'
or 'Tonic' (<b>diatonon toniaion</b>)<a name="FNanchor_1_34" id="FNanchor_1_34"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. The other was a 'mixture'
of this Diatonic with the standard Chromatic
(<b>chrôma suntonon</b>): that is to say, the octave consisted of
a tetrachord of each genus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
These octaves apparently might be of any <i>species</i>, according to the key chosen
<a name="FNanchor_1_35" id="FNanchor_1_35"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.
On the cithara,&mdash;which was a more elaborate form of
lyre, confined in practice to professional musicians,&mdash;six
different octave scales were employed, each of
a particular species and key. They are enumerated
and described by Ptolemy in two passages (<i>Harm.</i> i. 16
and ii. 16), which in some points serve to correct
each other<a name="FNanchor_2_36" id="FNanchor_2_36"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.
Of the six scales two are of the Hypo-dorian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
or Common species (<i>a-a</i>). One of these, called
<b>tritai</b>, is purely Diatonic of the Middle Soft variety;
the intervals expressed by fractions are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Westphal (<i>Harmonik und Melopöie</i>, 1863, p. 255) supposes a much deeper
corruption. He would restore <b>ta de lydia [kai iastia hoi tou migmatos tou
syntonou diatonou tou ... ta de ...] hoi tou toniaiou diatonou tou Dôriou</b>. This
introduces a serious discrepancy between the two passages, as the number
of scales in the second list is raised to eight (Westphal making <b>iastia</b> and
<b>iastiaioliaia</b> distinct scales, and furthermore inserting a new scale, of
unknown name). Moreover the (unknown) scale of unmixed <b>diatonon toniaion</b>
is out of its place at the end of the list. Westphal's objection to
<b>lydia</b> as the name of a scale of the <i>Dorian</i> species of course only holds good
on his theory of the Modes.</p>

<p>The only other differences between the two passages are:</p>

<p>(1) In the scales of the lyre called <b>malaka</b> the admixture, according to
i. 16, is one of <b>chrômatikon syntonon</b>, according to ii. 16 of <b>chr. malakon</b>. But,
as Westphal shows, Soft Chromatic is not admitted by Ptolemy as in
practical use. It would seem that in the second passage the copyist was
led astray by the word <b>malaka</b> just before.</p>

<p>(2) The <b>iastia</b> of i. 16 is called <b>astiaioliaia</b> in ii. 16. We need not
suppose the text to be faulty, since the two forms may have been both in use.</p>

<p>Another point overlooked in Westphal's treatment is that <b>diatonon syntonon</b>
and <b>d. ditoniaion</b> are not really distinguished by Ptolemy. In one passage
(i. 16) he gives his <b>lydia</b> and <b>iastia</b> as a mixture with <b>d. syntonon</b>, adding
that in practice it was <b>d. ditoniaion</b>. In the other (ii. 16) he speaks at once of
<b>d. ditoniaion</b>. This consideration brings the two places into such close agreement
that any hypothesis involving discrepancy is most improbable.</p>

<p>Regarding the tonality of these scales there is not
very much to be said. In the case of the Hypo-dorian
and Dorian octaves it will be generally thought probable
that the key-note is <i>a</i> (the <b>mesê kata dynamin</b>). If
so, the difference between the two species is not one of
'mode,'&mdash;in the modern sense,&mdash;but consists in the fact
that in the Hypo-dorian the compass of the melody is
from the key-note upwards, while in the Dorian it
extends a Fourth below the key-note. It is possible,
however, that the lowest note (<i>e</i>) of the Dorian octave
was sometimes the key-note: in which case the <i>mode</i>
was properly Dorian. In the Phrygian octave of
Ptolemy's description the key-note cannot be the
Fourth or Mesê <b>kata thesin</b> (<i>g</i>), since the interval <i>g-c</i>
is not consonant (9/8 × 9/8 × 28/27 being less than 4/3). Possibly
the lowest note (<i>d</i>) is the key-note; if so the scale is of
the Phrygian mode (in the modern sense). In the
Hypo-phrygian octave there is a similar objection to
regarding the Mesê <b>kata thesin</b> (<i>c</i>) as the key-note, and
some probability in favour of the lowest note (<i>g</i>). If
the Pythagorean division of the tetrachord <i>g-c</i> were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
replaced by the natural temperament, which the language
used by Ptolemy<a name="FNanchor_1_37" id="FNanchor_1_37"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> leads us to regard as the true
division, the scale would exhibit the intervals&mdash;</p>

<p>which give the natural chord of the Seventh. This
however is no more than a hypothesis.</p>

<p>It evidently follows from all this that Ptolemy's
octaves do not constitute a system of <i>modes</i>. They
are merely the groups of notes, of the compass of an
octave, which are most likely to be used in the several
keys, and which Ptolemy or some earlier theorist chose
to call by the names of those keys.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 32. <i>Remains of Greek Music.</i></h2>

<p>The extant specimens of Greek music are mostly of
the second century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, and therefore nearly contemporary
with Ptolemy. The most considerable are the
melodies of three lyrical pieces or hymns, viz. (1)
a hymn to Calliope, (2) a hymn to Apollo (or Helios),&mdash;both
ascribed to a certain Dionysius,&mdash;and (3) a hymn
to Nemesis, ascribed to Mesomedes<a name="FNanchor_2_38" id="FNanchor_2_38"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. Besides these
there are (4) some short instrumental passages or exercises
given by Bellermann's <i>Anonymus</i> (pp. 94-96).
And quite recently the list has been increased by (5) an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
inscription discovered by Mr. W. M. Ramsay, which
gives a musical setting of four short gnomic sentences,
and (6) a papyrus fragment (now in the collection of
the Arch-duke Rainer) of the music of a chorus in
the <i>Orestes</i> of Euripides. These two last additions to
our scanty stock of Greek music are set out and discussed
by Dr. Wessely of Vienna and M. Ruelle in the
<i>Revue des Études Grecques</i> (V. 1892, pp. 265-280), also by
Dr. Otto Crusius in the <i>Philologus</i>, Vol. LII, pp. 160-200
<a name="FNanchor_1_39" id="FNanchor_1_39"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<p>The music of the three hymns is noted in the Lydian
key (answering to the modern scale with one &#9837;). The
melody of the second hymn is of the compass of an
octave, the notes being those of the Perfect System
from Parhypatê Hypatôn to Tritê Diezeugmenôn (<i>f-f</i>
with one &#9837;). The first employs the same octave with
a lower note added, viz. Hypatê Hypatôn (<i>e</i>): the third
adds the next higher note, Paranêtê Diezeugmenôn (<i>g</i>).
Thus the Lydian key may be said, in the case of the
second hymn, and less exactly in the case of the two
others, to give the Lydian or <i>c</i>-species of the octave
in the most convenient part of the scale; just as on
Ptolemy's system of Modes we should expect it to do.</p>

<p>This octave, however, represents merely the <i>compass</i>
(<i>ambitus</i> or <i>tessitura</i>) of the melody: it has nothing to
do with its <i>tonality</i>. In the first two hymns, as Bellermann
pointed out, the key-note is the Hypatê Mesôn;
and the mode&mdash;in the modern sense of that word&mdash;is
that of the octave <i>e-e</i> (the Dorian mode of Helmholtz's
theory). In the third hymn the key-note appears to be
the Lichanos Mesôn, so that the mode is that of <i>g-g</i>,
viz. the Hypo-phrygian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the instrumental passages given by the <i>Anonymus</i>
three are clearly in the Hypo-dorian or common mode,
the Mesê (<i>a</i>) being the key-note. (See Gevaert, i.
p. 141.) A fourth (§ 104) also ends on the Mesê, but
the key-note appears to be the Parhypatê Mesôn (<i>f</i>).
Accordingly Westphal and Gevaert assign it to the
Hypo-lydian species (<i>f-f</i>). In Westphal's view the
circumstance of the end of the melody falling, not on
the key-note, but on the Third or Mediant of the octave,
was characteristic of the Modes distinguished by the
prefix <i>syntono-</i>, and accordingly the passage in question
is pronounced by him to be Syntono-lydian. All those
passages, however, are mere fragments of two or three
bars each, and are quoted as examples of certain peculiarities
of rhythm. They can hardly be made to lend
much support to any theory of the Modes.</p>

<p>The music of Mr. Ramsay's inscription labours under
the same defect of excessive shortness. If, however,
we regard the four brief sentences as set to a continuous
melody, we obtain a passage consisting of thirty-six
notes in all, with a compass of less than an octave,
and ending on the lowest note of that compass. Unlike
the other extant specimens of Greek music it is written
in the Ionian key&mdash;a curious fact which has not been
noticed by Dr. Wessely.</p>

<p>The notes which enter into this melody form the
scale <i>f&#9839;-g-a-b-c&#9839;-d-e-f&#9839;</i>, which is an octave
of the Dorian species (<i>e-e</i> on the white notes). Hence
if <i>f</i>&#9839;, on which the melody ends, is the key-note, the
<i>mode</i> is the Dorian. On the other hand the predominant
notes are those of the triad <i>a-c&#9839;-e</i>, which
point to the key of <i>a</i> major, with the difference that the
Seventh is flat (<i>g</i> instead of <i>g</i>&#9839;). On this view the
music would be in the Hypo-phrygian mode.</p>

<p>However this may be, the most singular feature of
this fragment remains to be mentioned, viz. the agreement
between the musical notes and the <i>accentuation</i>
of the words. We know from the grammarians that an
acute accent signified that the vowel was sounded
with a rise in the pitch of the voice, and that a circumflex
denoted a rise followed on the same syllable by
a lower note&mdash;every such rise and fall being quite
independent both of syllabic quantity and of stress or
<i>ictus</i>. Thus in ordinary speech the accents formed
a species of melody,&mdash;<b>logôdes ti melos</b>, as it is called
by Aristoxenus<a name="FNanchor_1_40" id="FNanchor_1_40"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.
When words were <i>sung</i> this 'spoken
melody' was no longer heard, being superseded by the
melody proper. Dionysius of Halicarnassus is at pains
to explain (<i>De Comp. Verb.</i>, c. 11), that the melody to
which words are set does not usually follow or resemble
the quasi-melody of the accents, <i>e.g.</i> in the following
words of a chorus in the <i>Orestes</i> of Euripides (ll. 140-142):&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><b>siga siga leukon ichnos arbylês</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>tithete, mê ktypeite;</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>apoprobat' ekeis' apopro moi koitas,</b><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he notices that the melody differs in several points from
the spoken accents: (1) the three first words are all on
the same note, in spite of the accents; (2) the last
syllable of <b>arbylês</b> is as high as the second, though
that is the only accented syllable: (3) the first syllable
of <b>tithete</b> is lower than the two others, instead of being
higher: (4) the circumflex of <b>ktypeite</b> is lost (<b>êphanistai</b>),
because the word is all on the same pitch; (5) the
fourth syllable of <b>apoprobate</b> is higher in pitch, instead
of the third. In Mr. Ramsay's inscription, however,
the music follows the accents as closely as possible.
Every acute accent coincides with a rise of pitch,
except in <b>hoson</b>, which begins the melody, and in <b>esti</b>,
for which we should perhaps read the orthotone <b>esti</b>.
Of the four instances of the circumflex accent three
exhibit the two notes and the falling pitch which we
expect. The interval is either a major or a minor
Third. In the other case (<b>zês</b>) the next note is a
Third lower: but it does not seem to belong to the
circumflexed syllable. All this cannot be accidental.
It leads us to the conclusion that the musical notes
represent a kind of recitative, or imitation of spoken
words, rather than a melody in the proper sense of
the term.</p>

<p>If any considerable specimen of the music of
Euripides had survived, it might have solved many
of the problems with which we have been dealing.
The fragment before us extends over about six lines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in dochmiac metre (<i>Orestes</i> 338-343), with the vocal
notation: but no single line is entire. The key is the
Lydian. The genus is either Enharmonic or Chromatic.
Assuming that it is Enharmonic&mdash;the alternative
adopted by Dr. Wessely&mdash;the characters which are
still legible may be represented in modern notation as
follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be observed that in the fragment the line
<b>katolophyromai katolophyromai</b> comes before 338 (<b>materos
k.t.l.</b>), not after it, as in our texts<a name="FNanchor_1_41" id="FNanchor_1_41"></a>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>The notes employed, according to the interpretation
given above, give the scale <i>g-a-a*-a&#9839;-d-e-e*</i>.
If the genus is Chromatic, as M. Ruelle is disposed
to think, they are <i>g-a-a&#9839;-b-d-e-f</i>. When these
scales are compared with the Perfect System we find
that they do not entirely agree with it. Whether the
genus is Enharmonic or Chromatic the notes from
<i>a</i> to <i>e*</i> (or <i>f</i>) answer to those of the Perfect System
(of the same genus) from Hypatê Mesôn to Tritê Diezeugmenôn.
But in either case the lowest note (<i>g</i>)
finds no place in the System, since it can only be the
Diatonic Lichanos Hypatôn. It is possible, however,
that the scale belongs to the period when the original
octave had been extended by the addition of a tone
below the Hypatê&mdash;the note, in fact, which we have
already met with under the name of Hyper-hypatê
(<a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>). Thus the complete scale may have consisted
of the disjunct tetrachords <i>a-d</i> and <i>e-a</i>, with the tone
<i>g-a</i>. It may be observed here that although the scale
in question does not fit into the Perfect System, it
conforms to the general rules laid down by Aristoxenus
for the melodious succession of intervals. It is unnecessary
therefore to suppose (as Dr. Wessely and
M. Ruelle do) that the scale exhibits a <i>mixture</i> of
different genera.</p>

<p>It must be vain to attempt to discover the tonality of
a short fragment which has neither beginning nor end.
The only group of notes which has the character of
a cadence is that on the word <b>(olo)phypomai</b>, and again on
the words <b>en brotois</b>, viz. the notes <i>a&#9839; a* a</i> (if the
genus is the Enharmonic). The same notes occur
in reversed order on <b>akatou</b> and <b>(kat)eklusen</b>. This
seems to bear out the common view of the Enharmonic
as produced by the introduction of an 'accidental' or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
passing note. It will be seen, in fact, that the Enharmonic
notes (<i>a*</i> and <i>e*</i>) only occur before or after the
'standing' notes (<i>a</i> and <i>e</i>).</p>

<p>Relying on the fact that the lowest note is <i>g</i>, Dr.
Wessely and M. Ruelle pronounce the mode to be the
Phrygian (<i>g-g</i> in the key with one &#9837;, or <i>d-d</i> in the
natural key). I have already put forward a different
explanation of this <i>g</i>, and will only add here that it
occurs twice in the fragment, both times on a short
syllable<a name="FNanchor_1_42" id="FNanchor_1_42"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.
The important notes, so far as the evidence
goes, are <i>a</i>, which twice comes at the end of a verse
(with a pause in the sense), and <i>e</i>, which once has that
position. If <i>a</i> is the key-note, the mode&mdash;in the modern
sense&mdash;is Dorian (the <i>e</i>-species). If <i>e</i> is the key-note, it
is Mixo-lydian (the <i>b</i>-species).</p>

<h2>§ 33. <i>Modes of Aristides Quintilianus.</i></h2>

<p>The most direct testimony in support of the view that
the ancient Modes were differentiated by the succession
of their intervals has still to be considered. It is the
account given by Aristides Quintilianus (p. 21 Meib.) of
the six Modes (<b>harmoniai</b>) of Plato's <i>Republic</i>. After
describing the genera and their varieties the 'colours,'
he goes on to say that there were other divisions of
the tetrachord (<b>tetrachordikai diaireseis</b>) which the most
ancient musicians used for the <b>harmoniai</b>, and that these
were sometimes greater in compass than the octave,
sometimes less. He then gives the intervals of the
scale for each of the six Modes mentioned by Plato,
and adds the scales in the ancient notation. They are
of the Enharmonic genus, and may be represented by
modern notes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Comparing these scales with the Species of the
Octave, we find a certain amount of correspondence.
As has been already noticed (<a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>), the names Syntono-lydian
and Lydian answer to the ordinary Lydian and
Hypo-lydian respectively. Accordingly the Lydian of
Aristides agrees with the Hypo-lydian species as given
in the pseudo-Euclidean <i>Introductio</i>. The Dorian of
Aristides is the Dorian species of the <i>Introductio</i>, but
with an additional note, a tone below the Hypatê.</p>

<p>The Phrygian of Aristides is not the Enharmonic
Phrygian species; but it is derived from the diatonic
Phrygian octave <i>d-e-f-g-a-b-c-d</i> by inserting
the enharmonic notes <i>e*</i> and <i>b*</i>, and omitting the
diatonic <i>g</i>. By a similar process the Mixo-lydian
of Aristides may be derived from the diatonic octave
<i>b-b</i>, except that <i>a</i> as well as <i>g</i> is omitted, and on the
other hand <i>d</i> is retained. If the scale of the Syntono-lydian
is completed by the lower <i>c</i> (as analogy would
require), it will answer similarly to the Lydian species
(<i>c-c</i>).</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 34. <i>Credibility of Aristides Quintilianus.</i></h2>

<p>But what weight can be given to Aristides as an
authority on the music of the time of Plato? The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
answer to this question depends upon several considerations.</p>

<p>1. The date of Aristides is unknown. He is certainly
later than Cicero, since he quotes the <i>De Republica</i>
(p. 70 Meib.). From the circumstance that he makes
no reference to the musical innovations of Ptolemy it
has been supposed that he was earlier than that writer.
But, as Aristides usually confines himself to the theory
of Aristoxenus and his school, the argument from silence
is not of much value. On the other hand he gives
a scheme of notation containing two characters,
<img alt="sharp" src="images/sharp01.gif" width="20" height="25" />
and <img alt="sharp" src="images/sharp02.gif" width="17" height="24" />,
which extend the scale two successive semi-tones
beyond the lowest point of the notation given
by Alypius<a name="FNanchor_1_43" id="FNanchor_1_43"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.
For this reason it is probable that
Aristides is one of the latest of the writers on ancient
music.</p>

<p>2. The manner in which Aristides introduces his
information about the Platonic Modes is highly suspicious.
He has been describing the various divisions
of the tetrachord according to the theory of Aristoxenus,
and adds that there were anciently other divisions in
use. So far Aristides is doubtless right, since Aristoxenus
himself says that the divisions of the tetrachord
are theoretically infinite in number (p. 26 Meib.),&mdash;that
it is possible, for example, to combine the Parhypatê of
the Soft Chromatic with the Lichanos of the Diatonic
(p. 52 Meib.). But all this concerns the genus of the
scale, and has nothing to do with the species of the
Octave, with which Aristides proceeds to connect it.
It follows either that there is some confusion in the
text, or that Aristides was compiling from sources which
he did not understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The Platonic Modes were a subject of interest to
the early musical writers, and were discussed by Aristoxenus
himself (Plut. <i>de Mus.</i> c. 17). If Aristoxenus
had had access to such an account as we have in
Aristides, we must have found some trace of it, either
in the extant <i>Harmonics</i> or in the quotations of Plutarch
and other compilers.</p>

<p>4. Of the four scales which extend to the compass of
an octave, only one, viz. the Dorian, conforms to the
rules which are said by Aristoxenus to have prevailed
in early Greek music. The Phrygian divides the
Fourth <i>a-d</i> into four intervals instead of three, by
the sequence <i>a b b* c d</i>. As has been observed, it is
neither the Enharmonic Phrygian species (<i>c e e* f a b b* c</i>),
nor the Diatonic <i>d-d</i>, but a mixture of the two.
Similarly the Mixo-lydian divides the Fourth <i>b</i>-<i>e</i> into
four intervals (<i>b b* c d e</i>), by introducing the purely
Diatonic note <i>d</i>. The Lydian is certainly the Lydian
Enharmonic species of the pseudo-Euclid; but we
can hardly suppose that it existed in practical music.
Aristoxenus lays it down emphatically that a quarter-tone
is always followed by another: and we cannot
imagine a scale in which the highest and lowest notes
are in no harmonic relation to the rest.</p>

<p>5. Two of the scales are incomplete, viz. the Ionian,
which has six notes and the compass of a Seventh, and
the Syntono-lydian, which consists of five notes, with
the compass of a Minor Sixth. We naturally look for
parallels among the defective scales noticed in the
<i>Problems</i> and in Plutarch's dialogues. But we find
little that even illustrates the modes of Aristides. The
scales noticed in the <i>Problems</i> (xix. 7, 32, 47) are hepta-chord,
and generally of the compass of an octave. In
one passage of Plutarch (<i>De Mus.</i> c. 11) there is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
description&mdash;quoted from Aristoxenus&mdash;of an older kind
of Enharmonic, in which the semitones had not yet
been divided into quarter-tones. In another chapter
(c. 19) he speaks of the omission of the Tritê and also
of the Nêtê as characteristic of a form of music called
the <b>spondeiakos tropos</b>. It may be said that in the
Ionian and Syntono-lydian of Aristides the Enharmonic
Tritê (<i>b*</i>) and the Nêtê (<i>e</i>) are wanting. But the Paramesê
(<i>b</i>) is also wanting in both these modes. And the
Ionian is open to the observation already made with
regard to the Phrygian, viz. that the two highest notes
(<i>c d</i>) involve a mixture of Diatonic with Enharmonic
scale. We may add that Plutarch (who evidently wrote
with Aristoxenus before him) gives no hint that the
omission of these notes was characteristic of any particular
modes.</p>

<p>6. It is impossible to decide the question of the modes
of Aristides without some reference to another statement
of the same author. In the chapter which treats
of Intervals (pp. 13-15 Meib.) he gives the ancient
division of two octaves, the first into dieses or quarter-tones,
the second into semitones. The former of these
(<b>hê para tois archaiois kata dieseis harmonia</b>) is as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="images/p_098.jpg" width="900" height="383" alt="Two Octaves" /></p>

<p>After every allowance has been made for the probability
that these signs or some of them have reached us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in a corrupt form, it is impossible to reduce them to the
ordinary notation, as Meibomius sought to do. The
scholar who first published them as they stand in the
MSS. (F. L. Perne, see Bellermann, <i>Tonleitern</i>, p. 62)
regarded them as a relic of a much older system of
notation. This is in accordance with the language
of Aristides, and indeed is the only view consistent with
a belief in their genuineness. They are too like the
ordinary notation to be quite independent, and cannot
have been put forward as an improvement upon it. Are
they, then, earlier? Bellermann has called our attention
to a peculiarity which seems fatal to any such claim.
They consist, like the ordinary signs, of two sets, one
written above the other, and in every instance one of
the pair is simply a reversed or inverted form of the
other. With the ordinary signs this is not generally
the case, since the two sets, the vocal and instrumental
notes, are originally independent. But it is the case
with the three lowest notes, viz. those which were
added to the series at a later time. When these additional
signs were invented the vocal and instrumental
notes had come to be employed together. The inventor
therefore devised a pair of signs in each case, and not
unnaturally made them correspond in form. In the
scale given by Aristides this correspondence runs
through the whole series, which must therefore be of
later date. But if this is so, the characters can hardly
represent a genuine system of notation. In other
words, Aristides must have been imposed upon by
a species of forgery.</p>

<p>7. Does the fragment of the <i>Orestes</i> tell for or against
the Modes described by Aristides?</p>

<p>The scale which is formed by the notes of the fragment
agrees, so far as it extends, with two of the scales
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
now in question, viz. the Phrygian and the Dorian.
Taking the view of its tonality expressed in the last
chapter (<a href="#Page_93">p. 93</a>), we should describe it as the Dorian
scale of Aristides with the two highest notes omitted.
The omission, in so short a fragment, is of little weight;
and the agreement in the use of an additional lower
note (Hyper-hypatê) is certainly worth notice. On
the other hand, the Dorian is precisely the mode, of
those given in the list of Aristides, which least needs
defence, as it is the most faithful copy of the Perfect
System. Hence the fact that it is verified by an actual
piece of music does not go far in support of the other
scales in the same list.</p>

<p>If our suspicions are well-founded, it is evident that
they seriously affect the genuineness of all the antiquarian
learning which Aristides sets before his readers,
and in particular of his account of the Platonic modes.
I venture to think that they go far to deprive that
account of the value which it has been supposed to
have for the history of the earliest Greek music.</p>

<p>For the later period, however, to which Aristides
himself belongs, these apocryphal scales are a document
of some importance. The fact that they do not
agree entirely with the species of the Octave as given
by the pseudo-Euclid leads us to think that they may
be influenced by scales used in actual music. This
applies especially to the Phrygian, which (as has been
shown) is really diatonic. The Ionian, again, is perhaps
merely an imperfect form of the same scale, viz. the
octave <i>d-d</i> with lower <i>d</i> omitted. And the Syntono-lydian
may be the Lydian diatonic octave <i>c-c</i> with
a similar omission of the lower <i>c</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 35. <i>Evidence for Scales of different species.</i></h2>

<p>The object of the foregoing discussion has been to
show, in the first place, that there was no such distinction
in ancient Greek music as that which scholars have
drawn between Modes (<b>harmoniai</b>) and Keys (<b>tonoi</b> or
<b>tropoi</b>): and, in the second place, that the musical scales
denoted by these terms were primarily distinguished
by difference of <i>pitch</i>,&mdash;that in fact they were so many
keys of the standard scale known in its final form as
the Perfect System. The evidence now brought
forward in support of these two propositions is surely
as complete as that which has been allowed to determine
any question of ancient learning.</p>

<p>It does not, however, follow that the Greeks knew of
no musical forms analogous to our Major and Minor
modes, or to the mediaeval Tones. On the contrary,
the course of the discussion has led us to recognise
distinctions of this kind in more than one instance.
The doctrine against which the argument has been
mainly directed is not that ancient scales were of more
than one species or 'mode' (as it is now called), but
that difference of species was the basis of the ancient
Greek Modes. This will become clear if we bring
together all the indications which we have observed of
scales differing from each other in species, that is, in the
<i>order</i> of the intervals in the octave. In doing so it will
be especially important to be guided by the principle
which we laid down at the outset, of arranging our
materials according to chronology, and judging of each
piece of evidence strictly with reference to the period
to which it belongs. It is only thus that we can hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to gain a conception of Greek music as the living and
changing thing that we know it must have been.</p>

<p>1. The principal scale of Greek music is undoubtedly
of the Hypo-dorian or common species. This is sufficiently
proved by the facts (1) that two octaves of this
species (<i>a-a</i>) constitute the scale known as the Greater
Perfect System, and (2) that the central <i>a</i> of this system,
called the Mesê, is said to have been the key-note, or at
least to have had the kind of importance in the scale
which we connect with the key-note (Arist. <i>Probl.</i> xix.
20). This mode, it is obvious, is based on the scale
which is the descending scale of the modern Minor
mode. It may therefore be identified with the Minor,
except that it does not admit the leading note.</p>

<p>It should be observed that this mode is to be recognised
not merely in the Perfect System but equally in
the primitive octave, of the form <i>e-e</i>, out of which the
Perfect System grew. The important point is the tonic
character of the Mesê (<i>a</i>), and this, as it happens, rests
upon the testimony of an author who knows the primitive
octave only. The fact that that octave is of the
so-called Dorian species does not alter the <i>mode</i> (as we
are now using that term), but only the compass of the
notes employed.</p>

<p>The Hypo-dorian octave is seen in two of the scales
of the cithara given by Ptolemy (<a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>), viz. those called
<b>tritai</b> and <b>tropoi</b>, and the Dorian octave (<i>e-e</i>) in two
scales, <b>parupatai</b> and <b>ludia</b>. It is very possible (as was
observed in commenting on them) that the two latter
scales were in the key of <i>a</i>, and therefore Hypo-dorian
in respect of mode. The Hypo-dorian mode is also
exemplified by three at least of the instrumental passages
given by the <i>Anonymus</i> (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>).</p>

<p>2. The earliest trace of a difference of species appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
to be found in the passage on the subject of the
Mixo-lydian mode quoted above (<a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>) from Plutarch's
<i>Dialogue on Music</i>. In that mode, according to Plutarch,
it was discovered by a certain Lamprocles of Athens that
the Disjunctive Tone was the highest interval, that is to
say, that the octave in reality consisted of two conjunct
tetrachords and a tone:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">
  <img src="images/p_103.jpg" width="900" height="190" alt="Disjunctive Tone" /><br />
  <a href="music/p_103.mid">[Listen]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the note which is the meeting-point of the two
tetrachords is doubtless the key-note, we shall not be
wrong in making it the Mesê, and thus finding the
octave in question in the Perfect System and in the
oldest part of it, viz. the tetrachords Mesôn and Synêmmenôn,
with the Nêtê Diezeugmenôn. How then did
this octave come to be recognised by Lamprocles as
distinctively Mixo-lydian? We cannot tell with certainty,
because we do not know what the Mixo-lydian
scale was before his treatment of it. Probably, however,
the answer is to be sought in the relation in respect of
pitch between the Dorian and Mixo-lydian keys. These,
as we have seen (<a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>), were the keys chiefly employed
in tragedy, and the Mixo-lydian was a Fourth higher
than the other. Now when a scale consisting of white
notes is transposed to a key a Fourth higher, it becomes
a scale with one &#9837;. In ancient language, the tetrachord
Synêmmenôn (<i>a-b&#9837;-c-d</i>) takes the place of the tetrachord
Diezeugmenôn. In some such way as this the
octave of this form may have come to be associated in
a special way with the use of the Mixo-lydian key.</p>

<p>However this may be, the change from the tetrachord
Diezeugmenôn to the tetrachord Synêmmenôn, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
reverse, is a change of mode in the modern sense, for it
is what the ancients classified as a change of System
(<b>metabolê kata systêma</b>)<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.
Nor is it hard to determine
the two 'modes' concerned, if we may trust to the
authority of the Aristotelian <i>Problems</i> (<i>l. c.</i>) and regard
the Mesê as always the key-note. For if <i>a</i> is kept as
the key-note, the octave <i>a-a</i> with one &#9837; is the so-called
Dorian (<i>e-e</i> on the white notes). In this way we
arrive at the somewhat confusing result that the ancient
Dorian species (<i>e-e</i> but with <i>a</i> as key-note) yields the
Hypo-dorian or modern Minor mode: while the Dorian
mode of modern scientific theory<a name="FNanchor_2_45" id="FNanchor_2_45"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
has its ancient prototype in the Mixo-lydian species, viz. the octave first
brought to light by Lamprocles. The difficulty of
course arises from the species of the Octave being
classified according to their compass, without reference
to the tonic character of the Mesê.</p>

<p>The Dorian mode is amply represented in the extant
remains of Greek music. It is the mode of the two
compositions of Dionysius, the Hymn to Calliope and
the Hymn to Apollo (<a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>), perhaps also of Mr. Ramsay's
musical inscription (<a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>). It would have been satisfactory
if we could have found it in the much more
important fragment of the <i>Orestes</i>. Such indications
as that fragment presents seem to me to point to the
Dorian mode (Mixo-lydian of Lamprocles).</p>

<p>3. The scales of the cithara furnish one example of
the Phrygian species (<i>d-d</i>), and one of the Hypo-phrygian
(<i>g-g</i>): but we have no means of determining
which note of the scale is to be treated as the key-note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Hymn to Nemesis, however, in spite of the
incomplete form in which it has reached us, there is
a sufficiently clear example of the Hypo-phrygian mode.
It has been suggested as possible that the melody of
Mr. Ramsay's inscription is also Hypo-phrygian, and if
so the evidence for the mode would be carried back to
the first century.</p>

<p>The Hypo-phrygian is the nearest approach made by
any specimen of Greek music to the modern Major
mode,&mdash;the Lydian or <i>c</i>-species not being found even
among the scales of the cithara as given by Ptolemy.
It is therefore of peculiar interest for musical history,
and we look with eagerness for any indication which
would allow us to connect it with the classical period
of Greek art. One or two sayings of Aristotle have
been thought to bear upon this issue.</p>

<p>The most interesting is a passage in the <i>Politics</i> (iv. 3,
cp. p. 13), where Aristotle is speaking of the multiplicity
of forms of government, and showing how a great
number of varieties may nevertheless be brought under
a few classes or types. He illustrates the point from
the musical Modes, observing that all constitutions
may be regarded as either oligarchical (government
by a minority) or democratical (government by the
majority), just as in the opinion of some musicians
(<b>hôs phasi tines</b>) all modes are essentially either Dorian
or Phrygian. What, then, is the basis of this grouping
of certain modes together as Dorian, while the rest are
Phrygian in character? According to Westphal it is
a form of the opposition between the true Hellenic
music, represented by Dorian, and the foreign music,
the Phrygian and Lydian, with their varieties. Moreover,
it is in his view virtually the same distinction as that
which obtains in modern music between the Minor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the Major scales<a name="FNanchor_1_46" id="FNanchor_1_46"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.
This account of the matter, however,
is not supported by the context of the passage. Aristotle
draws out the comparison between forms of government
and musical modes in such a way as to make it plain
that in the case of the modes the distinction was one of
pitch (<b>tas suntonôteras ... tas d' aneimenas kai malakas</b>).
The Dorian was the best, because the highest, of the
lower keys,&mdash;the others being Hypo-dorian (in the earlier
sense, immediately below Dorian), and Hypo-phrygian&mdash;while
Phrygian was the first of the higher series
which took in Lydian and Mixo-lydian. The division
would be aided, or may even have been suggested,
by the circumstance that it nearly coincided with the
favourite contrast of Hellenic and 'barbarous' modes<a name="FNanchor_2_47" id="FNanchor_2_47"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.
There is another passage, however, which can hardly be
reconciled with a classification according to pitch alone.
In the chapters dealing with the ethical character of
music Aristotle dwells (as will be remembered) upon the
exciting and orgiastic character of the Phrygian mode,
and notices its especial fitness for the dithyramb. This
fitness or affinity, he says, was so marked that a poet
who tried to compose a dithyramb in another mode
found himself passing unawares into the Phrygian (<i>Pol.</i>
viii. 7). It is natural to understand this of the use of
certain sequences of intervals, or of cadences, such as
are characteristic of a 'mode' in the modern sense of
the word, rather than of a change of key. If this is
so we may venture the further hypothesis that the
Phrygian music, in some at least of its forms, was
distinguished not only by pitch, but also by the more
or less conscious use of scales which differed in type
from the scale of the Greek standard system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be urged that this hypothesis is inconsistent
with our interpretation of the passage of the <i>Problems</i>
about the tonic character of the Mesê. If <i>a</i> is key-note,
it was argued, the mode is that of the <i>a</i>-species
(Hypo-dorian, our Minor), or at most&mdash;by admitting
the tetrachord Synêmmenôn&mdash;it includes the <i>e</i>-species
(Dorian of Helmholtz). The answer may be that the
statement of the <i>Problems</i> is not of this absolute kind.
It is not the statement of a technical writer, laying
down definite rules, but is a general observation, or at
best a canon of taste. We are not told how the
predominance of the Mesê is shown in the form of
the melody. Moreover this predominance is not said
to be exercised in music generally, but in all <i>good</i> music
(<b>panta gar ta chrêsta melê pollakis tê mesê chrêtai</b>).
This may mean either that tonality in Greek music was
of an imperfect kind, a question of style and taste rather
than of fixed rule, or that they occasionally employed
modes of a less approved stamp, unrecognised in the
earlier musical theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>§ 36. <i>Conclusion.</i></h2>

<p>The considerations set forth in the last chapter seem
to show that if difference of mode or species cannot be
entirely denied of the classical period of Greek music,
it occupied a subordinate and almost unrecognised
place.</p>

<p>The main elements of the art were, (1) difference of
<i>genus</i>,&mdash;the sub-divisions of the tetrachord which Aristoxenus
and Ptolemy alike recognise, though with
important discrepancies in detail; (2) difference of pitch
or <i>key</i>; and (3) <i>rhythm</i>. Passing over the last, as not
belonging to the subject of <i>Harmonics</i>, we may now
say that genus and key are the only grounds of distinction
which are evidently of practical importance. No
others were associated with the early history of the art,
with particular composers or periods, with particular
instruments, or with the ethos of music. This, however,
is only true in the fullest sense of Greek music
before the time of Ptolemy. The main object of
Ptolemy's reform of the keys was to provide a new
set of scales, each characterised by a particular succession
of intervals, while the pitch was left to take care of
itself. And it is clear, especially from the specimens
which Ptolemy gives of the scales in use in his time,
that he was only endeavouring to systematise what
already existed, and bring theory into harmony with
the developments of practice. We must suppose, therefore,
that the musical feeling which sought variety in
differences of key came to have less influence on the
practical art, and that musicians began to discover, or to
appreciate more than they had done, the use of different
'modes' or forms of the octave scale.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Along with this change we have to note the comparative
disuse of the Enharmonic and Chromatic
divisions of the tetrachord. The Enharmonic, according
to Ptolemy, had ceased to be employed. Of the
three varieties of Chromatic given by Aristoxenus only
one remains on Ptolemy's list, and that the one which
in the scheme of Aristoxenus involved no interval less
than a semitone. And although Ptolemy distinguished
at least three varieties of Diatonic, it is worth notice
that only one of these was admitted in the tuning of
the lyre,&mdash;the others being confined to the more
elaborate cithara. In Ptolemy's time, therefore, music
was rapidly approaching the stage in which all its forms
are based upon a single scale&mdash;the natural diatonic
scale of modern Europe.</p>

<p>In the light of these facts it must occur to us that
Westphal's theory of seven modes or species of the
Octave is really open to an <i>a priori</i> objection as decisive
in its nature as any of the testimony which has
been brought against it. Is it possible, we may ask,
that a system of modes analogous to the ecclesiastical
Tones can have subsisted along with a system of scales
such as the genera and 'colours' of early Greek music?
The reply may be that Ptolemy himself combines the
two systems. He supposes five divisions of the tetrachord,
and seven modes based upon so many species of
the Octave&mdash;in all thirty-five different scales (or seventy,
if we bring in the distinction of octaves <b>apo nêtês</b> and
<b>apo mesês</b>). But when we come to the scales actually
used on the chief Greek instrument, the cithara, the
number falls at once to six. Evidently the others, or
most of them, only existed on paper, as the mathematical
results of certain assumptions which Ptolemy
had made. And if this can be said of Ptolemy's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
theory, what would be the value of a similar scheme
combining the modes with the Enharmonic and the
different varieties of the Chromatic genus? The truth
is, surely, that such a scheme tries to unite elements
which belong to different times, which in fact are the
fundamental ideas of different stages of art.</p>

<p>The most striking characteristic of Greek music,
especially in its earlier periods, is the multiplicity and
delicacy of the intervals into which the scale was
divided. A sort of frame-work was formed by the
division of the octave into tetrachords, completed by
the so-called disjunctive tone; and so far all Greek
music was alike. But within the tetrachord the reign
of diversity was unchecked. Not only were there
recognised divisions containing intervals of a fourth,
a third, and even three-eighths of a tone, but we gather
from several things said by Aristoxenus that the number
of possible divisions was regarded as theoretically
unlimited. Thus he tells us that there was a constant
tendency to flatten the 'moveable' notes of the Chromatic
genus, and thus diminish the small intervals, for
the sake of 'sweetness' or in order to obtain a plaintive
tone<a name="FNanchor_1_48" id="FNanchor_1_48"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>;&mdash;
that the Lichanos of a tetrachord may in theory
be any note between the Enharmonic Lichanos (<i>f</i> in
the scale <i>e-e*-f-a</i>) and the Diatonic (<i>g</i> in the scale
<i>e-f-g-a</i>)<a name="FNanchor_2_49" id="FNanchor_2_49"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>;&mdash;
and that the magnitude of the smaller
intervals and division of the tetrachord generally
belongs to the indefinite or indeterminate element in
music<a name="FNanchor_1_50" id="FNanchor_1_50"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.
Moreover, in spite of the disuse of several of
the older scales, much of this holds good for the time
of Ptolemy. The modern diatonic scale is fully recognised
by him, but only as one of several different
divisions. And the division which he treats as the
ordinary or standard form of the octave is not the
modern diatonic scale, but one of the so-called 'soft'
or flattened varieties. It is clear that in the best
periods of Greek music these refinements of melody,
which modern musicians find scarcely conceivable,
were far from being accidental or subordinate features.
Rather, they were as much bound up with the fundamental
nature of that music as complex harmony is with
the music of modern Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>The mediaeval modes or Tones, on the other hand,
are essentially based on the diatonic scale,&mdash;the scale
that knows only of tones and semitones. To suppose
that they held in the earliest Greek music the prominent
place which we find assigned to the ancient Modes or
<b>harmoniai</b> is to suppose that the art of music was developed
in Greece in two different directions, under the influence
of different and almost opposite ideas. Yet nothing is
more remarkable in all departments of Greek art than
the strictness with which it confines itself within the
limits given once for all in the leading types, and the
consequent harmony and consistency of all the forms
which it takes in the course of its growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The dependence of artistic forms in their manifold
developments upon a central governing idea or principle
has never been more luminously stated than
by the illustrious physicist Helmholtz, in the thirteenth
chapter of his <i>Tonempfindungen</i>. I venture to think
that in applying that truth to the facts of Greek music
he was materially hindered by the accepted theory of
the Greek modes. The scales which he analyses under
that name were certainly the basis of all music in the
Middle Ages, and are much more intelligible as such
than in relation to the primitive Greek forms of the art

<h2>§ 37. <i>Epilogue&mdash;Speech and Song.</i></h2>

<p>Several indications combine to make it probable that
singing and speaking were not so widely separated from
each other in Greek as in the modern languages with
which we are most familiar.</p>

<p>(1) The teaching of the grammarians on the subject
of accent points to this conclusion. Our habit of using
Latin translations of the terms of Greek grammar has
tended to obscure the fact that they belong in almost
every case to the ordinary vocabulary of music. The
word for 'accent' (<b>tonos</b>) is simply the musical term for
'pitch' or 'key.' The words 'acute' (<b>oxys</b>) and 'grave'
(<b>barys</b>) mean nothing more than 'high' and 'low' in
pitch. A syllable may have two accents, just as in
music a syllable may be sung with more than one note.
Similarly the 'quantity' of each syllable answers to the
time of a musical note, and the rule that a long syllable
is equal to two short ones is no doubt approximately
correct. Consequently every Greek word (enclitics
being reckoned as parts of a word) is a sort of musical
phrase, and every sentence is a more or less definite
melody&mdash;<b>logôdes ti melos</b>, as it is called by Aristoxenus
(p. 18 Meib.). Moreover the accent in the modern
sense, the <i>ictus</i> or stress of the voice, appears to be
quite independent of the pitch or 'tonic' accent: for in
Greek poetry the <i>ictus</i> (<b>arsis</b>) is determined by the
metre, with which the tonic accent evidently has nothing
to do. In singing, accordingly, the tonic accents disappear;
for the melody takes their place, and gives
each syllable a new pitch, on which (as we shall
presently see) the spoken pitch has no influence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
The rise and fall of the voice in ordinary speaking
is perceptible enough in English, though it is more
marked in other European languages. Helmholtz tells
us&mdash;with tacit reference to the speech of North Germany&mdash;that
an affirmative sentence generally ends with
a drop in the tone of about a Fourth, while an interrogative
is marked by a rise which is often as much as
a Fifth<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.
In Italian the interrogative form is regularly
given, not by a particle or a change in the order of
the words, but by a rise of pitch. The Gregorian
church music, according to a series of rules quoted by
Helmholtz (<i>l. c.</i>), marked a comma by a rise of a Tone,
a colon by a fall of a Semitone; a full stop by a Tone
above, followed by a Fourth below, the 'reciting note';
and an interrogation by a phrase of the form <i>d b c d</i>
(<i>c</i> being the reciting note).</p>

<p>These examples, however, do little towards enabling
modern scholars to form a notion of the Greek system
of accentuation. In these and similar cases it is the
<i>sentence as a whole</i> which is modified by the tonic
accent, whereas in Greek it is the individual <i>word</i>. It
is true that the accent of a word may be affected by its
place in the sentence: as is seen in the loss of the
accent of oxytone words when not followed by a pause,
in the anastrophe of prepositions, and in the treatment
of the different classes of enclitics. But in all these
instances it is the intonation of the word as such, not
of the sentence, which is primarily concerned. What
they really prove is that the musical accent is not so
invariable as the stress accent in English or German,
but may depend upon the collocation of the word,
or upon the degree of emphasis which it has in
a particular use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The same conclusion may be drawn from the
terms in which the ancient writers on music endeavour
to distinguish musical and ordinary utterance.</p>

<p>Aristoxenus begins his <i>Harmonics</i> by observing that
there are two movements of the voice, not properly discriminated
by any previous writer; namely, the <i>continuous</i>,
which is the movement characteristic of speaking, and
the <i>discrete</i> or that which proceeds by <i>intervals</i>, the
movement of singing. In the latter the voice remains
for a certain time on one note, and then passes by
a definite interval to another. In the former it is continually
gliding by imperceptible degrees from higher
to lower or the reverse<a name="FNanchor_1_53" id="FNanchor_1_53"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.
In this kind of movement the rise and fall of the voice is marked by the <i>accents</i>
(<b>prosôdiai</b>), which accordingly form the melody, as it
may be called, of spoken utterance<a name="FNanchor_2_54" id="FNanchor_2_54"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.
Later writers state the distinction in much the same language.
Nicomachus tells us that the two movements were
first discriminated by the Pythagoreans. He dwells
especially on the ease with which we pass from one to
the other. If the notes and intervals of the speaking
voice are allowed to be separate and distinct, the form
of utterance becomes singing<a name="FNanchor_3_55" id="FNanchor_3_55"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.
Similarly Aristoxenus says that we do not rest upon a note, unless we are
led to do so by the influence of feeling (<b>an mê dia pathos
pote eis toiautên kinêsin anankasthômen elthein</b>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the rhetorician Dionysius of Halicarnassus
the interval used in the melody of spoken
utterance is approximately a Fifth, or three tones and
a half (<b>dialektou men oun melos heni metreitai diastêmati
tô legomenô dia pente, hôs engista; kai oute epiteinetai
pera tôn triôn tonôn kai hêmitoniou epi to oxy oute anietai
tou chôriou toutou pleion epi to bary</b>
<a name="FNanchor_1_56" id="FNanchor_1_56"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>). He gives an
interesting example (quoted above on <a href="#Page_91">p. 91</a>) from the
<i>Orestes</i> of Euripides, to show that when words are set
to music no account is taken of the accents, or spoken
melody. Not merely are the intervals varied (instead
of being nearly uniform), but the rise and fall of the
notes does not answer to the rise and fall of the
syllables in ordinary speech. This statement is rendered
the more interesting from the circumstance that
the inscription discovered by Mr. Ramsay (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>),
which is about a century later, does exhibit precisely
this correspondence. Apparently, then, the melody of
the inscription represents a new idea in music,&mdash;an
attempt to bring it into a more direct connexion with
the tones of the speaking voice. The fact of such an
attempt being made seems to indicate that the divergence
between the two kinds of utterance was becoming
more marked than had formerly been the case. It may
be compared with the invention of recitative in the
beginning of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Aristides Quintilianus (p. 7 Meib.) recognises a third
or intermediate movement of the voice, viz. that which
is employed in the recitation of poetry. It is probable
that Aristides is one of the latest writers on the subject,
and we may conjecture that in his time the Greek
language had in great measure lost the original tonic
accents, and with them the quasi-melodious character
which they gave to prose utterance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>In the view which these notices suggest the difference
between speaking and singing is reduced to one of
degree. It is analysed in language such as we might
use to express the difference between a monotonous and
a varied manner of speaking, or between the sounds
of an Aeolian harp and those of a musical instrument.</p>

<p>(3) What has been said of melody in the two spheres
of speech and song applies also <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to
rhythm. In English the time or quantity of syllables is
as little attended to as the pitch. But in Greek the
distinction of long and short furnished a prose rhythm
which was a serious element in their rhetoric. In
the rhythm of music, according to Dionysius, the
quantity of syllables could be neglected, just as the
accent was neglected in the melody<a name="FNanchor_1_57" id="FNanchor_1_57"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.
This, however, does not mean that the natural time of the syllables
could be treated with the freedom which we see in
a modern composition. The regularity of lyric metres
is sufficient to prove that the increase or diminution of
natural quantity referred to by Dionysius was kept
within narrow limits, the nature of which is to be
gathered from the remains of the ancient system of
Rhythmic. From these sources we learn with something
like certainty that the rhythm of ordinary speech,
as determined by the succession of long or short
syllables, was the basis not only of metres intended
for recitation, such as the hexameter and the iambic
trimeter, but also of lyrical rhythm of every kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) As to the use of the stress accent in Greek
prose we are without direct information. In verse it
appears as the metrical <i>ictus</i> or <i>arsis</i> of each foot, which
answers to what English musicians call the 'strong
beat' or accented part of the bar<a name="FNanchor_1_58" id="FNanchor_1_58"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. In the Homeric
hexameter the ictus is confined to long syllables, and
appears to have some power of lengthening a short
or doubtful syllable. In the Attic poetry which was
written in direct imitation of colloquial speech, viz.
the tragic and comic trimeter, there is no necessary
connexion between the ictus and syllabic length: but
on the other hand a naturally long syllable which is
without the ictus may be rhythmically short. In lyrical
versification the ictus does not seem to have any connexion
with quantity: and on the whole we may gather
that it was not until the Byzantine period of Greek
that it came to be recognised as a distinct factor in
pronunciation. The chief elements of utterance&mdash;pitch,
time and stress&mdash;were independent in ancient Greek
speech, just as they are in music. And the fact that
they were independent goes a long way to prove our
main contention, viz. that ancient Greek speech had
a peculiar quasi-musical character, consequently that
the difficulty which modern scholars feel in understanding
the ancient statements on such matters as
accent and quantity is simply the difficulty of conceiving
a form of utterance of which no examples can now be observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The conception which we have thus been led to
form of ancient Greek as it was spoken is not without
bearing on the main subject of these pages. For if the
language even in its colloquial form had qualities of
rhythm and intonation which gave it this peculiar half
musical character, so that singing and speaking were
more closely akin than they ever are in our experience,
we may expect to find that music was influenced in
some measure by this state of things. What is there,
then, in the special characteristics of Greek music
which can be connected with the exceptional relation in
which it stood to language?</p>

<p>Greek music was primarily and chiefly vocal. Instrumental
music was looked upon as essentially subordinate,&mdash;an
accompaniment or at best an imitation of singing.
For in the view of the Greeks the words (<b>lexis</b>) were
an integral part of the whole composition. They contained
the ideas, while the music with its variations of
time (<b>rhythmos</b>) and pitch (<b>harmonia</b>) furnished a natural
vehicle for the appropriate feelings. Purely instrumental
music could not do this, because it could not convey the
ideas or impressions fitted to be the object of feeling.
Hence we find Plato complaining on this ground of the
separation of poetry and music which was beginning to
be allowed in his time. The poets, he says, rend asunder
the elements of music; they separate rhythm and dance
movements from melody, putting unmusical language
into metre, and again make melody and rhythm without
words, employing the lyre and the flute without the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
voice: so that it is most difficult, when rhythm and
melody is produced without language, to know what
it means, or what subject worthy of the name it
represents (<b>kai hotô eoike tôn axiologôn mimêmatôn</b>). It is
utterly false taste, in Plato's opinion, to use the flute
or the lyre otherwise than as an accompaniment to
dance and song<a name="FNanchor_1_59" id="FNanchor_1_59"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.
Similarly in the Aristotelian <i>Problems</i>
(xix. 10) it is asked why, although the human voice is
the most pleasing, singing without words, as in humming
or whistling, is not more agreeable than the flute or the
lyre. Shall we say, the writer answers, 'that the human
voice too is comparatively without charm if it does not
<i>represent</i> something? (<b>ê oud' ekei, ean mê mimêtai, homoiôs
hêdy?</b>) That is to say, music is expressive of <i>feeling</i>,
which may range from acute passion to calm and lofty
sentiment, but feeling must have an object, and this can
only be adequately given by language. Thus language
is, in the first instance at least, the matter to which
musical treatment gives artistic form. In modern times
the tendency is to regard instrumental music as the
highest form of the art, because in instrumental music
the artist creates his work, not by taking ideas and
feelings as he finds them already expressed in language,
but directly, by forming an independent vehicle of
feeling,&mdash;a new language, as it were, of passion and
sentiment,&mdash;out of the absolute relations of movement
and sound.</p>

<p>The intimate connexion in Greek music between
words and melody may be shown in various particulars.
The modern practice of basing a musical composition&mdash;a
long and elaborate chorus, for example&mdash;upon a few
words, which are repeated again and again as the music
is developed, would have been impossible in Greece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>It becomes natural when the words are not an integral
part of the work, but only serve to announce the idea
on which it is based, and which the music brings out
under successive aspects. The same may be said of
the use of a melody with many different sets of words.
Greek writers regard even the repetition of the melody
in a strophe and antistrophe as a concession to the comparative
weakness of a chorus. With the Greeks,
moreover, the union in one artist of the functions of
poet and musician must have tended to a more exquisite
adaptation of language and music than can be expected
when the work of art is the product of divided labour.
In Greece the principle of the interdependence of language,
metre, and musical sound was carried very far.
The different recognised styles had each certain metrical
forms and certain musical scales or keys appropriated
to them, in some cases also a certain dialect and vocabulary.
These various elements were usually summed up
in an ethnical type, one of those which played so large
a part in their political history. Such a term as Dorian
was not applied to a particular scale at random, but
because that scale was distinctive of Dorian music:
and Dorian music, again, was one aspect of Dorian
temper and institutions, Dorian literature and thought.</p>

<p>Whether the Greeks were acquainted with harmony&mdash;in
the modern sense of the word&mdash;is a question that
has been much discussed, and may now be regarded as settled
<a name="FNanchor_1_60" id="FNanchor_1_60"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.
It is clear that the Greeks were acquainted
with the phenomena on which harmony depends, viz.
the effect produced by sounding certain notes together.
It appears also that they made some use of harmony,&mdash;and
of dissonant as well as consonant intervals,&mdash;in
instrumental accompaniment (<b>krousis</b>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand it was unknown in their vocal music, except in
the form of bass and treble voices singing the same
melody. In the instrumental accompaniment it was
only an occasional ornament, not a necessary or regular
part of the music. Plato speaks of it in the <i>Laws</i> as
something which those who learn music as a branch of
liberal education should not attempt<a name="FNanchor_1_61" id="FNanchor_1_61"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. The silence of
the technical writers, both as to the use of harmony and
as to the tonality of the Greek scale, points in the same
direction. Evidently there was no <i>system</i> of harmony,&mdash;no
notion of the effect of <i>successive</i> harmonies, or of
two distinct <i>parts</i> or progressions of notes harmonising
with each other.</p>

<p>The want of harmony is to be connected not only with
the defective tonality which was probably characteristic
of Greek music,&mdash;we have seen (<a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>) that there is
some evidence of tonality,&mdash;but still more with the non-harmonic
quality of many of the intervals of which their
scales were composed. We have repeatedly dwelt upon
the variety and strangeness (to our apprehension) of
these intervals. Modern writers are usually disposed
to underrate their importance, or even to explain them
away. The Enharmonic, they point out, was produced
by the interpolation of a note which may have been only
a passing note or <i>appoggiatura</i>. The Chromatic also, it
is said, was regarded as too difficult for ordinary performers,
and most of its varieties went out of use at a
comparatively early period. Yet the accounts which we
find in writers so remote in time and so opposed in their
theoretical views as Aristoxenus and Ptolemy, bear the
strongest testimony to the reality and persistence of
these non-diatonic scales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>And we have the decisive fact that of the six scales of the cithara given by Ptolemy
(<a href="#Page_85">see p. 85</a>) not one is diatonic in the modern sense of
the word. It may be alleged on the other side that the
ideal scale in the <i>Timaeus</i> of Plato is purely diatonic,
and exhibits the strictest Pythagorean division. But
that scale is primarily a framework of mathematical
ratios, and could not take notice of intervals which had
not yet been identified with ratios. It is not certain
when the discovery of Pythagoras was extended to the
non-diatonic scales. Even in the <i>Sectio Canonis</i> of Euclid
there is no trace of knowledge that any intervals except
those of the Pythagorean diatonic scale had a numerical
or (as we should say) physical basis<a name="FNanchor_1_62" id="FNanchor_1_62"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. In Plato's time,
as we can see from a well-known passage of the <i>Republic</i>
(quoted on <a href="#Page_53">p. 53</a>), the Enharmonic and Chromatic scales
were the object of much zealous study and experiment
on the part of musicians of different schools,&mdash;some
seeking to measure and compare the intervals directly
by the ear, others to find numbers in the consonances
which they heard, and both, from the Platonic point
of view, 'setting ears above intelligence,' and therefore
labouring in vain<a name="FNanchor_1_63" id="FNanchor_1_63"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The multiplicity of intervals, then, which surprises us
in the doctrine of the <i>genera</i> and 'colours' was not an
accident or excrescence. And although some of the
finer varieties, such as the Enharmonic, belong only to
the early or classical period, there is enough to show
that it continued to be characteristic of the Greek
musical system, at least until the revival of Hellenism
in the age of the Antonines. The grounds of this
peculiarity may be sought partly in the Greek temperament.
We can hardly deny the Greeks the credit of a
fineness of sensibility upon which civilisation, to say the
least, has made no advance. We may note further how
entirely it is in accordance with the analogies of Greek
art to find a series of artistic types created by subtle
variations within certain well-defined limits. For the
present purpose, however, it will be enough to consider
how the phenomenon is connected with other known
characteristics of Greek music,&mdash;its limited compass and
probably imperfect tonality, the thin and passionless
quality of its chief instrument, on the other hand the
keen sense of differences of pitch, the finely constructed
rhythm, and finally the natural adaptation, on which we
have already dwelt, between the musical form and the language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>The last is perhaps the feature of greatest
significance, especially in a comparison of the ancient
and modern types of the art. The beauty and even the
persuasive effect of a voice depend, as we are more or
less aware, in the first place upon the pitch or key in
which it is set, and in the second place upon subtle
variations of pitch, which give emphasis, or light and
shade. Answering to the first of these elements ancient
music, if the main contention of this essay is right, has
its system of Modes or keys. Answering to the second
it has a series of scales in which the delicacy and
variety of the intervals still fill us with wonder. In
both these points modern music shows diminished
resources. We have in the Keys the same or even
a greater command of degrees of pitch: but we seem
to have lost the close relation which once obtained
between a note as the result of physical facts and the
same note as an index of temper or emotion. A change
of key affects us, generally speaking, like a change of
colour or of movement&mdash;not as the heightening or
soothing of a state of feeling. In respect of the second
element of vocal expression, the rise and fall of the
pitch, Greek music possessed in the multiplicity of its
scales a range of expression to which there is no
modern parallel. The nearest analogue may be found
in the use of modulation from a Major to a Minor key,
or the reverse. But the changes of genus and 'colour'
at the disposal of an ancient musician must have been
acoustically more striking, and must have come nearer
to reproducing, in an idealised form, the tones and
inflexions of the speaking voice. The tendency of
music that is based upon harmony is to treat the voice
as one of a number of instruments, and accordingly
to curtail the use of it as the great source of dramatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and emotional effect. The consequence is twofold.
On the one hand we lose sight of the direct influence
exerted by sound of certain degrees of pitch on the
human sensibility, and thus ultimately on character.
On the other hand the music becomes an independent
creation. It may still be a vehicle of the deepest
feeling: but it no longer seeks the aid of language,
or reaches its aim through the channels by which
language influences the mind of man.</p>

Aristoxenus, though not named, is doubtless aimed at there.

<p>The metre is dochmiac, each dochmius consisting of an
iambus followed by a cretic,

The points which
seem to mark the ictus, or rhythmical accent, are found on the
first syllable of each of these two feet. If we assume that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
first syllable of the iambus has the chief accent, the dochmius
will be correctly expressed as a musical bar of the form&mdash;</p>

<p>The accompaniment or <b>krousis</b>, consisting of notes interposed
between the phrases of the melody, is found by Dr. Wessely
and Dr. Crusius in the following characters:</p>

<p>1. The character <img alt="instrumentalZ" src="images/instrumental_z.gif" width="28" height="29" />
appears at the end of every dochmius
shown by the papyrus. After the first, third and fifth it is
written in the same line with the text. After the seventh it is
written above that line, between two vocal notes. Dr. Crusius
takes it to be the instrumental <b>Z</b>, explaining the difference of
shape as due to the necessity or convenience of distinguishing
it from the vocal <b>Z</b>. If that were so the form
<img alt="instrumentalZ" src="images/instrumental_z.gif" width="28" height="29" /> would surely
have been permanent, and would have been given in the
schemes of Alypius and Aristides Quintilianus. I venture to
suggest that it is a mark intended to show the end of the
dochmius or bar.</p>

<p>2. The group <img alt="triad08" src="images/triad08.gif" width="55" height="37" />
occurs twice, before and after the

<img alt="sign" src="images/sign01.gif" width="20" height="22" />,
which Dr. Crusius takes to be a <i>Vortragszeichen</i>. The
other two characters may be instrumental notes.</p>

<p>The double <b>&omega;</b> of <b>&omega;&sigmaf;</b> (written <b>&Omega;&Omega;&Sigma;</b>) is interesting because it
shows that when more than one note went with a syllable,
the vowel or diphthong was repeated. This agrees with the
well-known <b>hei-ei-ei-ei-ei-eilissete</b> of Aristophanes (<i>Ran.</i> 1314),
and is amply confirmed by the newly discovered hymn to Apollo (<a href="#Page_134">p. 134</a>).

  <i>The hymns recently discovered at Delphi.</i></p>

<p>Since these sheets were in type the materials for the study
of ancient Greek music have received a notable accession.
The French archaeologists who are now excavating on the
site of Delphi have found several important fragments of
lyrical poetry, some of them with the music noted over the
words, as in the examples already known. The two largest
of these fragments have been shown to belong to a single
inscription, containing a hymn to Apollo, which dates in all
probability from the early part of the third century <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> Of
the other fragments the most considerable is plausibly referred
to the first century <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> These inscriptions have been
published in the <i>Bulletin de correspondance hellénique</i> (viii-xii.
pp. 569-610), with two valuable commentaries by M.
Henri Weil and M. Théodore Reinach. The former scholar
deals with the text, the latter chiefly with the music.</p>

<p>The music of the hymn to Apollo is written in the vocal
notation. The metre is the cretic or paeonic
<img alt="symbols" src="images/circledash02.gif" width="107" height="28" />, and
the key, as M. Reinach has shown, is the Phrygian&mdash;the
scale of C minor, with the conjunct tetrachord <i>c&mdash;d&#9837;&mdash;d&mdash;f</i>.</p>

<p>In the following transcription I have followed M. Reinach
except in a few minor points. When two notes are sung
to the same syllable the vowel or diphthong is repeated,
as in the fragment of the Orestes (<a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>): but I have
thought it best to adhere to the modern method.</p>

The notes employed in this piece of music cover about an
octave and a half, viz. from Parypatê Hypatôn to the Chromatic
Lichanos Hyperbolaiôn. In two of the tetrachords,
viz. Synemmenôn and Hyperbolaiôn, the intervals employed
are Chromatic (or possibly Enharmonic): in the tetrachord
Diezeugmenôn they are Diatonic, while in the tetrachord
Mesôn the Lichanos, which would distinguish the genus, is
wanting. On the other hand there are two notes which do
not belong to the Phrygian key as hitherto known, viz. <b>O</b>, a
semitone below Mesê, and <b>B</b>, a semitone below Nêtê Diezeugmenôn.
If we assume that we have before us Chromatic
of the standard kind (<b>chrôma toniaion</b>), the complete scale is&mdash;</p>

 <a href="music/p_138b.mid">[Listen]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the intervals are Enharmonic, or Chromatic of a different
variety, the moveable notes (in this case
<img alt="lambda_kappa" src="images/lambda_kappa.gif" width="39" height="24" /> and
<img alt="peace_star" src="images/peace_star.gif" width="69" height="25" />) will
be somewhat flatter.</p>

<p>M. Reinach is particularly happy in tracing the successive
changes of genus and key in the course of the poem. The
opening passage, as he shows, is Diatonic. With the mention
of the Gaulish invasion (<b>Galatan arês</b>) we come upon the
group <img alt="triad09" src="images/triad09.gif" width="109" height="20" />
(<i>g&mdash;a&#9837;&mdash;a</i>) of the Chromatic tetrachord Hyperbolaiôn.
At the beginning of the second fragment the intervals
are again Diatonic, up to the point where the poet turns
to address the Attic procession (<b>ithi, klyta megalopolis Aththis, k.t.l.</b>).
From this point the melody lies chiefly in the Chromatic
tetrachord Synemmenôn <img alt="tetrachord05" src="images/tetrachord05.gif" width="98" height="20" />
(<i>c&mdash;d&#9837;&mdash;d&mdash;f</i>)&mdash;a modulation
into the key of the sub-dominant as well as a change
of genus. At the end of the fragment the poet returns to
the Diatonic and the original key.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
With regard to the <i>mode</i>&mdash;the question which mainly
concerns us at present&mdash;M. Reinach's exposition is clear
and convincing. He appeals to three criteria,&mdash;(1) the impression
which the music makes on a modern ear; (2) the
endings of the several phrases and divisions; and (3) the
note which recurs most frequently. All these criteria point
to a Minor mode. The general impression made by the
Diatonic parts of the melody is that of the key of <i>C</i> minor:
the rhythmical periods end on one or other of the notes
<i>c-e&#9837;-g</i>, which form the chord of that key: and the note <i>c</i>
distinctly predominates. This conclusion, it need hardly be
said, is in entire agreement with the main thesis of the preceding
pages.</p>

<p>The symbols <b>O</b> and <b>B</b>, which do not belong to the Phrygian
scale, are explained by M. Reinach in a way that is in
a high degree plausible and suggestive. In other keys, he
observes, the symbol <b>O</b> stands for the note <i>b</i> (natural). Thus
it holds the place of 'leading-note' (<i>note sensible</i>) to the keynote,
<i>c</i>. It has hitherto been supposed that the standard
scale of Greek music, the octave <i>a-a</i>, differed from the
modern Minor in the want of a leading note. Here, however,
we find evidence that such a note was known in practice,
if not as a matter of theory, to Greek musicians. If this is
so, it strongly confirms the view that <i>c</i> was in fact the key-note
of the Phrygian scale. The symbol <b>B</b>, which occurs
only once, answers to our <i>g</i>&#9837;, and may be similarly explained
as a leading note to <i>g</i>, the dominant of the key. We infer,
with M. Reinach, that the scale employed in the hymn is
not only like, but identical with, the scale of our Minor.</p>

<p>The fragment marked <b>C</b> by M. Weil resembles the hymn
to Apollo in subject, and also in metre, but cannot belong to
the same work. The melody is written in the Lydian key,
with the notation which we have hitherto known as the
instrumental, but which is now shown to have been used,
occasionally at least, for vocal music. The fragment is as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<span class="i0"><b>Phoi-bon on e-tik-te L[a-tô]</b></span>
</div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>M. Reinach connects this fragment with a shorter one, also
in the Lydian key, but not in paeonic metre, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>M. Reinach thinks that the mode may be the so-called
Hypo-lydian (the octave <i>f&mdash;f</i>). The materials are surely
too scanty for any conclusion as to this.</p>

<p>The fragment D, the only remaining piece which M.
Reinach has found it worth while to transcribe, is also
written in the instrumental notation of the Lydian key. The
metre is the glyconic. The fragment is as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This piece also is referred by M. Reinach to the Hypo-lydian
mode. It may surely be objected that of three places
in which we may fairly suppose that we have the end of
a metrical division, viz. those which end with the words
<b>Delphôn, prospolois</b> and <b>agêratô</b>, two present us with cadences
on the Mesê (<i>d</i>), and one on the Hypatê (<i>a</i>). This seems to
point strongly to the Minor Mode.</p>

<p>On the whole it would seem that the only <i>mode</i> (in the
modern sense of the word) of which the new discoveries tell
us anything is a mode practically identical with the modern
Minor. I venture to think this a confirmation, as signal
as it was unexpected, of the main contention of this treatise.</p>

<p>It does not seem to have been observed by M. Weil or
M. Reinach that in all these pieces of music there is the
same remarkable correspondence between the melody and
the accentuation that has been pointed out in the case of
the Seikelos inscription (<a href="#Page_90">pp. 90, 91</a>). It cannot indeed be
said that every acute accent coincides with a rise of pitch:
but the note of an accented syllable is almost always followed
by a note of lower pitch. Exceptions are, <b>aiolon, hina</b>
(which may have practically lost its accent, cp. the Modern
Greek <b>na</b>), and <b>molete</b> (if rightly restored). The fall of pitch
in the two notes of a circumflexed syllable is exemplified in
<b>manteion, heilen, Galatan, Phoibon, ôdaisi, klytais, bômoisin, homou:</b> the
opposite case occurs only once, in <b>thnatois</b>. The observation
holds not only of the chief hymn, but of all the fragments.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Note on the Seikilos Inscription</i> (<a href="#Page_89">pp. 89-91, 133</a>).</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the publication of this work, the Seikilos inscription
has been examined afresh by Mr. J. A. R. Munro (of Lincoln
College, Oxford). The result of his examination is to show
that the last note of the melody has been misread. From
a squeeze which he has kindly placed at my disposal it
appears that the word <b>apaitei</b> is written&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">
  <img src="images/p_145a.jpg" width="437" height="200" alt="Sympols" />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The line drawn under the three notes
<img alt="triad10" src="images/triad10.gif" width="56" height="24" />
has caused the last to be read as
<img alt="reversegamma" src="images/reverse_gamma.gif" width="24" height="23" />,
which has no meaning here. In fact
it is a reversed Gamma (<b>g apestrammenon</b>), and answers to our
<i>e</i> natural.</p>

<p>Hence the last line of the transcription on pp. 89-90
should be as follows:</p>


<p class="center">
  <img src="images/p_145b.jpg" width="900" height="161" alt="Music Score" /><br />
  <b>to te-los ho chro-nos a-pai&mdash;tei</b><br /><br />
  <a href="music/p_145b.mid">[Listen]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The importance of this correction is obvious. The scale
employed is now seen to be the octave&mdash;</p>

<h2><i>e&emsp;f&#9839; &emsp;g&emsp;a&emsp;b&emsp;c&#9839; &emsp;d&emsp;e</i></h2>


<p>If, as I ventured to suggest on <a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>, the mode is the
Hypo-phrygian (the scale of our Major mode, but with a
flat Seventh), the key-note will be <i>a</i>. The close on the
Dominant <i>e</i> will then have to be noted as a fact supporting
the belief that in Greek music the close on the Dominant or
Hypatê was the usual one (<a href="#Page_45">see p. 45</a>).</p>

<p>The line drawn under the three symbols
<img alt="triad11" src="images/triad11.gif" width="62" height="37" /> is found in
several other cases where the melody gives more than one
note for a syllable. So
<img alt="diad01" src="images/diad01.gif" width="38" height="32" /> (l. 2), and
<img alt="diad02" src="images/diad02.gif" width="45" height="34" /> (l. 3),
<img alt="diad03" src="images/diad03.gif" width="31" height="33" /> and
<img alt="diad02" src="images/diad02.gif" width="45" height="34" />
(l. 4). It does not appear however under
<img alt="triad12" src="images/triad12.gif" width="50" height="24" /> (l. 1).</p>

It is foreign to our purpose to discuss the critical problems presented by
the text of Aristoxenus. Of the three extant books the first is obviously
a distinct treatise, and should probably be entitled <b>peri archôn</b>. The other
two books will then bear the old title <b>harmonika stoicheia</b>. They deal with the
same subjects, for the most part, as the first book, and in the same order,&mdash;a
species of repetition of which there are well-known instances in the
Aristotelian writings. The conclusion is abrupt, and some important topics
are omitted. It seems an exaggeration, however, to describe the <i>Harmonics</i>
of Aristoxenus as a mere collection of excerpts, which is the view taken by
Marquard (<i>Die harmonischen Fragmente des Aristoxenus</i>, pp. 359-393). See
Westphal's <i>Harmonik und Melopöie der Griechen</i> (p. 41, ed. 1863), and the
reply to Marquard in his <i>Aristoxenus von Tarent</i> (pp. 165-170).
is not given in the <i>Harmonics</i> which we have: but we
find there what is in some respects more valuable,
namely, a vivid account of the state of things in respect
of tonality which he observed in the music of his time.</p></div>

<i>Harm.</i> p. 37, 19 Meib. <b>houtô gar hoi men tôn harmonikôn legousi barytaton
men ton Hypodôrion tôn tonôn, hêmitoniô de oxyteron toutou ton Mixolydion, toutou
de hêmitoniô ton Dôrion, tou de Dôriou tonô ton Phrygion: hôsautôs de kai tou Phrygiou
ton Lydion heterô tonô.</b> Westphal (<i>Harmonik und Melopöie</i> p. 165) would
transfer the words <b>hêmitoniô ... Mixolydion</b> to the end of the sentence, and insert
<b>oxyteron</b> before <b>ton Dôrion</b>. The necessity for this insertion shows that
Westphal's transposition is not in itself an easy one. The only reason for it
is the difficulty of supposing that there could have been so great a difference
in the pitch of the Mixo-lydian scale. As to this, however,
<a href="#Page_23">see p. 23</a> (note).</p>

<p>The words <b>Hypophrygion aulon</b> have also been condemned by Westphal
(<i>Aristoxenus</i>, p. 453). He points out the curious contradiction between
<b>pros tên tôn aulôn trypêsin blepontes</b> and the complaint <b>ti d' esti pros ho blepontes
... ouden eirêkasin</b>. But if <b>pros tên ... blepontes</b> was a marginal gloss,
as Westphal suggests, it was doubtless a gloss on <b>aulon</b>, and if so, <b>aulon</b> is
presumably sound. Since the <b>aulos</b> was especially a Phrygian instrument,
and regularly associated with the Phrygian mode (as we know from Aristotle,
<a href="#Page_13"> see p. 13</a>),
nothing is more probable than that there was a variety of flute
called Hypo-phrygian, because tuned so as to yield the Hypo-phrygian key,
either by itself or as a modulation from the Phrygian.</p>

<p>In this scheme the important feature&mdash;that which
marks it as an advance on the others referred to by
Aristoxenus&mdash;is the conformity which it exhibits with
the diatonic scale. The result of this conformity is
that the keys stand in a certain relation to each other.
Taking any two, we find that certain notes are common
to them. So long as the intervals of pitch were quite
arbitrary, or were practically irrational quantities, such
as three-quarters of a tone, no such relation could exist.
It now became possible to pass from one key to another,
<i>i. e.</i> to employ <i>modulation</i> (<b>metabolê</b>) as a source of
musical effect. This new system had evidently made
some progress when Aristoxenus wrote, though it was
not perfected, and had not passed into general use.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

An objection to this identification has been based on the words of
Pollux, <i>Onom.</i> iv. 78 <b>kai harmonia men aulêtikê Dôristi, Phrygisti, Lydios kai
Iônikê, kai syntonos Lydisti ên Anthippos exeure</b>. The source of this statement,
or at least of the latter part of it, is evidently the same as that of the notice
in Plutarch. The agreement with Plato's list makes it probable that this
source was some comment on the passage in the <i>Republic</i>. If so, it can
hardly be doubted that Pollux gives the original terms, the Platonic <b>Lydisti</b>
and <b>Syntonolydisti</b>, and consequently that the later Lydian is not to be found
in his <b>Lydios</b> (which is a 'relaxed' mode), but in his <b>syntonos Lydisti</b>. There
is no difficulty in supposing that the mode was called <b>syntonos</b> merely in
contrast to the other.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

It seems not impossible that this difficulty with regard to the 'slack
Lydian' and Hypo-lydian may be connected with the contradiction in the
statement of Aristoxenus about the schemes of keys in his time (<a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>).
According to that account, if the text is sound, some musicians placed the
Mixo-lydian a semitone below the Dorian&mdash;the Hypo-dorian being again
a semitone lower. In this scheme, then, the Mixo-lydian held the place
of the later Hypo-lydian. The conjecture may perhaps be hazarded, that
this lower Mixo-lydian somehow represents Plato's 'slack Lydian,' and
eventually passed into the Hypo-lydian.</p></div>

This is especially evident in the case of the Lichanos; as was observed
by Aristides Quintilianus, who says (p. 10 Meib.): <b>hai kai tô genei lichanoi
prosêgoreuthêsan, homônymôs tô plêttonti daktylô tên êchousan autas chordên

The term <b>hyperypatê</b> had all but disappeared from the text of Theon
Smyrnaeus in the edition of Bullialdus (Paris, 1644), having been corrupted
into <b>hypatê</b> or <b>parypatê</b> in every place except one (p. 141, 3). It has been
restored from MSS. in the edition of Hiller (Teubner, Leipzig, 1878). The
word occurs also in Aristides Quintilianus (p. 10 Meib.), where the plural
<b>hyperypatai</b> is used for the notes below Hypatê, and in Boethius (<i>Mus.</i> i. 20).</p>

<p>It may be worth noticing also that Thrasyllus uses the words <b>diezeugmenê</b>
and <b>hyperbolaia</b> in the sense of <b>nêtê diezeugmenôn</b> and <b>nêtê hyperbolaiôn</b> (Theon
Smyrn. <i>l. c.</i>).</p></div>

The <i>Introduction to Harmonics</i> (<b>eisagôgê harmonikê</b>) which bears the
name of Euclid in modern editions (beginning with J. Pena, Paris, 1557) cannot
be his work. In some MSS. it is ascribed to Cleonides, in others to Pappus,
who was probably of the fourth century <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> The author is one of the
<b>harmonikoi</b> or Aristoxeneans, who adopt the method of equal temperament.
He may perhaps be assigned to a comparatively early period on the ground
that he recognises only the thirteen keys ascribed to Aristoxenus&mdash;not
the fifteen keys given by most later writers (Aristides Quint., p. 22 Meib.).
For some curious evidence connecting it with the name of the otherwise
unknown writer Cleonides, see K. von Jan, <i>Die Harmonik des Aristoxenianers
Kleonides</i> (Landsberg, 1870). The <i>Section of the Canon</i> (<b>kanonos
katatomê</b>) belongs to the mathematical or Pythagorean school, dividing the
tetrachord into two major tones and a <b>leimma</b> which is somewhat less than
a semitone. In point of form it is decidedly Euclidean: but we do not find
it referred to by any writer before the third century <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>&mdash;the earliest
testimony being that of Porphyry (pp. 272-276 in Wallis' edition).</p></div>

So in the Euclidean <i>Sectio Canonis</i> the propositions which deal with the
'movable' notes, viz. Paranêtê and Lichanos (Theor. xvii) and Parhypatê

The term <b>hêgemôn</b> or 'leading note' of the tetrachord Mesôn, here
applied to the Mesê, is found in the same sense in Plutarch, <i>De Mus.</i> c. 11,
where <b>ho peri ton hêgemona keimenos tonos</b>] means the disjunctive tone.
Similarly Ptolemy (<i>Harm.</i> i. 16) speaks of the tones in a diatonic scale
as being <b>en tois hêgoumenois topois</b>, the semitones <b>en tois hepomenois</b> (sc. of the
tetrachord): and again of the ratio 5:4 (the major Third) as the 'leading'
one of an Enharmonic tetrachord (<b>ton epitetarton hos estin hêgoumenos tou
enarmoniou genous</b>).</p></div>

This point is one which Aristoxenus is fond of insisting upon: cp. p. 10,
16 <b>ou pros tên katapyknôsin blepontas hôsper hoi harmonikoi</b>: p. 38, 3 <b>hoti de estin
hê katapyknôsis ekmelês kai panta tropon achrêstos phaneron</b>: p. 53, 3 <b>kata tên
tou melous physin zêtêteon to hexês kai ouch hôs hoi eis tên katapyknôsin blepontes
eiôthasin apodidonai to hexês</b>.</p>

<p>The statement that the ancient diagrams gave a series of twenty-eight
successive dieses or quarter-tones has not been explained. The number of
quarter-tones in an octave is only twenty-four. Possibly it is a mere error
of transcription (<b>&kappa;&eta;</b> for <b>&kappa;&delta;</b>). If not, we may perhaps connect it with the
seven intervals of the ordinary octave scale, and the simple method by
which the enharmonic intervals were expressed in the instrumental notation.
It has been explained that raising a note a quarter of a tone was shown by
turning it through a quarter of a circle. Thus, our <i>c</i> being denoted by
<img title="epsilon02" alt="epsilon02" src="images/epsilon02.gif" width="25" height="21" />,
<i>c</i>* was
<img title="epsilon04" alt="epsilon04" src="images/epsilon04.gif" width="19" height="13" />,
and <i>c</i>&#9839; was
<img title="epsilon03" alt="epsilon03" src="images/epsilon03.gif" width="25" height="21" />.
 Now the ancient diagrams, which divided every
tone into four parts, must have had a character for <i>c</i>&#9839;*, or the note
three-quarters of a tone above <i>c</i>. Naturally this would be the remaining
position of
<img title="epsilon02" alt="epsilon02" src="images/epsilon02.gif" width="25" height="21" />,
namely
<img title="epsilon05" alt="epsilon05" src="images/epsilon05.gif" width="19" height="13" />.
Again, we have seen that when the interval
between two notes on the diatonic scale is only a semitone, the result
of the notation is to produce a certain number of duplicates, so to speak.
Thus: <img title="kappa01" alt="kappa01" src="images/kappa01.gif" width="19" height="20" />
stands for <i>b</i>, and therefore
<img title="kappa02" alt="kappa02" src="images/kappa02.gif" width="19" height="20" />
for <i>c</i>: but <i>c</i> is a note of the original
scale, and as such is written
<img title="gamma01" alt="gamma01" src="images/gamma01.gif" width="17" height="19" />.
 It may be that the diagrams to which
Aristoxenus refers made use of these duplicates: that is to say, they may
have made use of all four positions of a character (such as
<img title="4kappas" alt="4kappas" src="images/4kappas.gif" width="98" height="18" />)
whether the interval to be filled was a tone or a semitone. If so, the seven
intervals would give twenty-eight characters (besides the upper octave-note),
and apparently therefore twenty-eight dieses. Some traces of this use of
characters in four positions have been noticed by Bellermann (<i>Tonleitern</i>,
p. 65).]</p></div>

The fullest account of this curious fragment of notation is that given
by Bellermann in his admirable book, <i>Die Tonleitern und Musiknoten der
Griechen</i>, pp. 61-65. His conjectures as to its origin do not claim a high
degree of probability. See the remarks on <a href="#Page_97">pp. 97-99.</a></p></div>

It may even be that this sense of <b>harmonia</b> was connected with the use
for the Enharmonic genus. It is at least worth notice that the phrase
<b>ha ekaloun harmonias</b> in this passage answers to the adjective <b>enarmoniôn</b> in the
passage first quoted (compare the words <b>peri autôn monon tôn hepta oktachordôn

The two passages enumerate the scales in a slightly different manner.
In i. 16 they are arranged in view of the genus or colour into&mdash;</p>
<p><br />
Pure Middle Soft Diatonic, viz.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;"><b>sterea</b>, of the lyre.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;"><b>tritai</b>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}&nbsp; of the cithara.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;"><b>hypertropa</b>&nbsp; }</span><br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
Mixture of Chromatic, viz.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;"><b>malaka</b>, of the lyre.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;"><b>tropika</b>, of the cithara.</span><br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
Mixture of Soft Diatonic, viz.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;"><b>parypatai</b>, of the cithara.</span><br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
Mixture of <b>diatonon syntonon</b>, viz.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;"><b>lydia</b>&nbsp; }&nbsp; of the cithara.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;"><b>iastia</b> }</span><br />
</p>
<p>It is added, however, that in their use of this last 'mixture' musicians are
in the habit of tuning the cithara in the Pythagorean manner, with two
Major tones and a <b>leimma</b> (called <b>diatonon ditoniaion</b>).</p>

<p>In the second passage (ii. 16) the scales of the lyre are given first, then
those of the cithara with the key of each. The order is the same, except
that <b>parypatai</b> comes before <b>tropika</b> (now called <b>tropoi</b>), and <b>lydia</b> is placed
last. The words <b>ta de lydia hoi tou toniaiou diatonou</b> [sc. <b>arithmoi periechousi</b>
<b>tou dôriou</b> cannot be correct, not merely because they contradict the statement
of the earlier passage that <b>lydia</b> denoted a mixture with <b>diatonon
syntonon</b> (or in practice <b>diatonon ditoniaion</b>), but also because the scales that
do not admit mixture are placed first in the list in both passages. Hence
we should doubtless read <b>ta de lydia hoi [tou migmatos] tou [di]toniaiou diatonou
tou Dôriou</b>.]</p></div>

It seems needless to set out these melodies here. The first satisfactory
edition of them is that of Bellermann, <i>Die Hymnen des Dionysius und
Mesomedes</i> (Berlin, 1840). They are given by Westphal in his <i>Musik des
griechischen Alterthumes</i> (1883), and by Gevaert, <i>Musique de l'Antiquité</i>,
vol. i. pp. 445 ff.; also in Mr. W. Chappell's <i>History of Music</i> (London, 1874),
where the melodies of the first and third hymns will be found harmonised
by the late Sir George Macfarren.

The melody published by Kircher (<i>Musurgia</i>, i. p. 541) as a fragment of

I need not repeat what is said by Dr. Wessely and M. Ruelle in defence
of the genuineness of our fragment. They justly point to the remarkable
coincidence that the music of this very play is quoted by Dionysius of
Halicarnassus (<i>l. c.</i>). It would almost seem as if it was the only well-known
specimen of music of the classical period of tragedy.</p>

In the 1886 edition of the same book (p. 189) Westphal discovers a similar
classification of modes implied in the words of Plato, <i>Rep.</i> p. 400 a <b>tri' atta
estin eidê ex hôn hai baseis plekontai, hôsper en tois phthongois tettara hothen hai
pasai harmoniai</b>. But Plato is evidently referring to some matter of common
knowledge. The three forms or elements of which all rhythms are made
up are of course the ratios 1: 1, 2: 1 and 3: 2, which yield the three kinds
of rhythm, dactylic, iambic and cretic (answering to common, triple, and
quintuple time). Surely the four elements of all musical scales of which
Plato speaks are not four kinds of scale (<i>Harmonien-Klassen</i>), but the four
ratios which give the primary musical intervals&mdash;viz. the ratios 2: 1, 3: 2,
4: 3 and 9: 8, which give the Octave, Fifth, Fourth and Tone.</p></div>

The ecclesiastical Modes received their final shape in the <i>Dodecachordon</i>
of Glareanus (Bâle, 1547). They are substantially the Greek modes of
Westphal's theory, although the Greek names which Glareanus adopted
seem to have been chosen at haphazard. But the ecclesiastical Modes, as
Helmholtz points out, were developed under the influence of polyphonic
music from the earlier stages represented by the Ambrosian and Gregorian
scales. It would be a singular chance if they were also, as Greek modes,
the source from which the Ambrosian and Gregorian scales were themselves
derived.</p>

<p>Some further hints on this part of the subject may possibly be derived
from the musical scales in use among nations that have not attained to any
form of harmony, such as the Arabians, the Indians, or the Chinese.
A valuable collection of these scales is given by Mr. A. J. Ellis at the end of
his translation of Helmholtz (Appendix XX. Sect. K, <i>Non-harmonic Scales</i>).
Among the most interesting for our purpose are the eight mediaeval Arabian
scales given on the authority of Professor Land (nos. 54-61). The first three
of these&mdash;called 'Ochaq, Nawa and Boasili&mdash;follow the Pythagorean intonation,
and answer respectively to the Hypo-phrygian, Phrygian, and Mixo-lydian
species of the octave. The next two&mdash;Rast and Zenkouleh&mdash;are also
Hypo-phrygian in species, but the Third and Sixth are flatter by about an
eighth of a tone (the Pythagorean comma). In Zenkouleh the Fifth also
is similarly flattened. The last two scales&mdash;Hhosaini and Hhidjazi&mdash;are
Phrygian: but the Second and Fifth, and in the case of Hhidjazi also the
Sixth, are flatter by the interval of a comma. The remaining scale, called
Rahawi, does not fall under any species, since the semitones are between
the Third and Fourth, and again between the Fifth and Sixth. It will be
seen that in general character&mdash;though by no means in details&mdash;this series
of scales bears a considerable resemblance to the 'scales of the cithara'
as given by Ptolemy (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>). In both cases the several scales are
distinguished from each other partly by the order of the intervals (<i>species</i>),
partly by the intonation, or magnitude of the intervals employed (<i>genus</i>).
This latter element is conspicuously absent from the ecclesiastical Modes.</p></div>

The metrical accent or ictus was marked in ancient notation by points
placed over the accented syllable. These points have been preserved in
Mr. Ramsay's musical inscription (see the Appendix, <a href="#Page_133">p. 133</a>) and in one or
two places of the fragment of the <i>Orestes</i> (<a href="#Page_130">p. 130</a>). Hence Dr. Crusius has
been able to restore the rhythm with tolerable certainty, and has made the
interesting discovery that in both pieces the ictus falls as a rule on a short
syllable. The only exceptions in the inscription are circumflexed syllables,
where the long vowel or diphthong is set to two notes, the first of which is
short and accented. The accents on the short first syllables of the dochmiacs
of Euripides are a still more unexpected evidence of the same rhythmical tendency.</p></div>

In Euclid's <i>Sectio Canonis</i> the Pythagorean division is assumed, and
there is no hint of any other ratio than those which Pythagoras discovered.
Prop. xvii shows how to find the Enharmonic Lichanos and Paranêtê by
means of the Fourth and Fifth. Prop. xviii proves against Aristoxenus
(of course without naming him), that a <b>pyknon</b> cannot be divided into two
equal intervals; but there is no attempt to explain the nature of the
Enharmonic diesis. It is worth notice that in these propositions the Lichanos
and Paranêtê of the Enharmonic scale are called <b>lichanos</b> and <b>paranêtê</b> simply,
as though the Enharmonic were the only genus&mdash;a usage which agrees with
that of the Aristotelian <i>Problems</i> (supra, <a href="#Page_33">p. 33</a>).</p>

<p>According to Ptolemy (i. 13) the Pythagorean philosopher Archytas was
the author of a new division of the tetrachord for each of the three genera.
In it the natural Major Third (5: 4) was given for the large interval of the
Enharmonic, in place of the Pythagorean ditone (81: 64); and the Diatonic
was the same as the Middle Soft Diatonic of Ptolemy. But, as Westphal
long ago pointed out (<i>Harmonik und Melopöie</i>, p. 230, ed. 1863), this scheme
is probably the work of the later Pythagorean school. It seems to be
unknown to Plato and Aristoxenus,&mdash;the latter wrote a life of Archytas&mdash;and
also to Euclid, as we have seen. The next scheme of musical ratios is
that of Eratosthenes, who makes no use of the natural Major Third.</p></div>

The two schools distinguished by Plato seem to be those which were
afterwards known as the <b>harmonikoi</b> or Aristoxeneans, and the <b>mathêmatikoi</b>,
who carried on the tradition of Pythagoras. The <b>harmonikoi</b> regarded a musical
interval as a quantity which could be measured directly by the ear, without
reference to the numerical ratio upon which it might be based. They practically
adopted the system of equal temperament. The <b>mathêmatikoi</b> sought
for ratios, but by experiment 'among the consonances which are heard,' as
Plato says. Hence they failed equally with those whose method never rose
above the facts of sense.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
